	- The scheduler now stops printers if the backend for the
	  queue is missing on startup (STR #1265)

	  init process instead of the original parent process
	  (STR #1258)
	- Added new on-line help CGI to web interface to provide
	  searchable help.
	- Devices are now tracked dynamically, with each query
	  doing a new device scan.  This eliminates a previous
	  startup delay caused by slow backends and allows new
	  printers to be seen without restarting the server,
	  however it limits the amount of device URI checking
	  that can be done (basically now the scheduler only
	  requires a URI with a method that is a listed backend)
	- Added new printer auto-detection, server configuration,
	  and log file viewing to the administration web page.
	- Added new "set allowed users" web interface to set the
	  list of allowed users for a printer or class.
	- The scheduler, command-line, and web interfaces now
	  limit the list of printers and classes to those
	  accessible by a user.

	  properly with IPv6 addresses (STR #1134)
	- The lp and lpr commands did not error out properly when
	  they were unable to write to a temporary file (STR
	  #1129)
	- The pstops filter did not handle Adobe-specific
	  comments in Windows NT driver output (STR #1085)
	- "lpstat -l -p" incorrectly reported the printer
	  interface (STR #936)
	- The web interface now operates exclusively with the
	  UTF-8 encoding, and sends the appropriate character set
	  and header information to the web browser (STR #919,
	  STR #1007)
	- Added a "set allowed users" interface to the web
	  interface so that you can set the list of allowed or
	  denied users/groups for a printer or class.
	- Disallow the "#" character in printer names, since it
	  has special meaning in the shell, config files, and in
	  URIs (STR #917, STR #1202)
	- Added a new application/x-csource MIME type, and
	  support for it to the texttops filter so that you can
	  pretty print plain text files without the C/C++
	  keywords being highlighted.
	- The pdftops filter did not compile with GCC 4.0 (STR
	  #1226)
	- The texttops filter did not highlight preprocessor
	  directives followed by a tab properly.

	  commands to show the current job on the printer's
	  display (STR #1218)
	- Local authentication certificates are now stored in
	  /var/run/cups/certs by default instead of
	  /etc/cups/certs (STR #1211)
	- Backends now use "&" to separate options in device
	  URIs; "+" is still recognized but is deprecated (STR
	  #842)
	- The USB backend no longer supports the usb:/dev/foo
	  format on systems that support device ID queries.
	- Forced classification markings did not work when the
	  job-sheets parameters were "none,none".
	- "lpstat -l -p" incorrectly showed all users as allowed,
	  even if the queue was restricted to certain users (STR
	  #801)
	- The scheduler now automatically detects SSL/TLS clients
	  without using the SSLPort/SSLListen directives.
	- The CUPS API and scheduler no longer support SSLv2-
	  encrypted connections.
	- Updated the cupsaddsmb utility to correctly export the
	  CUPS driver for Windows.
	- Fixed a signal-handling bug in httpRead() which
	  ultimately caused the server to print multiple copies
	  when it was busy (STR #1184)
	- The cupsFile API now uses the O_APPEND option when
	  opening files in append mode (STR #990)
	- The md5.h header and md5_* functions are now officially
	  private and have been renamed to avoid conflicts with
	  other implementations with the same name.
	- The pdftops filter incorrectly embedded some Type1
	  fonts (STR #1093)
	- The scheduler didn't detect a closed connection in the
	  middle of an IPP request (STR #1153)
	- The scheduler could block trying to read the job status
	  if there was input pending and the job was cancelled in
	  the same input cycle (STR #1157)
	- The scheduler could crash when deleting a class due to
	  infinite recursion.
	- Updated the Zebra ZPL label printer driver to use the
	  run-length encoding and support more options.
	- Updated serial backend to scan for /dev/ttyC* as well
	  as /dev/ttyc* for Cyclades serial ports (STR #1049)
	- The scheduler could hang reading the job status under
	  certain circumstances (STR #1068)
	- The USB backend termination signal code was inverted
	  (STR #1046)
	- Moved enable and disable commands to sbindir to be
	  consistent.
	- Added new cupsRasterInterpretPPD() function for RIP
	  filters to setup the raster page header from
	  PostScript commands in a PPD file.
	- The CUPS browsing protocol now offers a "delete" bit
	  to remove printers as soon as they are deleted on the
	  server or as soon as the server shuts down gracefully
	  (STR #793)
	- The CUPS_SERVER and ServerName directives (client.conf
	  and ~/.cupsrc) may now contain names of the form
	  "server:port" and "/path/to/domain/socket".
	- The "cancel -u user" command now works for ordinary
	  users (STR #751)
	- Added test run support to "make test" target (STR #64)
	- Added domain socket support (STR #656)
	- Added BrowseLocalOptions directive to allow the
	  administrator to add printer URI options to the browse
	  URI, e.g. "encryption=required" (STR #732)
	- Added BrowseRemoteOptions directive to allow the
	  administrator to add standard URI options to the
	  remote printer URI, e.g. "encryption=required" (STR
	  #732)
	- Now put "-I.." compiler option in front of all others
	  to ensure that local CUPS headers are used before
	  installed headers (STR #437)

	  per-printer control over what users and groups are
	  allowed to do various IPP operations.
	- New error policy mechanism to control how aborted
	  backend errors are handled by the scheduler
	  (abort-job, retry-job, requeue-job, stop-printer)
	- Updated the printer test page with a better color
	  wheel and a separate grayscale ramp.
	- A single backend process is now run to send all print
	  data for a job.
	- Backends and filters can now send and receive
	  backchannel data over file descriptor 3.
	- Updated the raster stream format to support more
	  user-defined attributes and to do compression of the
