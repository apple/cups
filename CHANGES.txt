CHANGES IN CUPS V1.3

	- Documentation updates (STR #1775, STR #2130, STR #2131,
	  STR #2356)
	- Added a new printer attribute called "cups-version"
	  which reports the version of CUPS that is running
	  (STR #2240)
	- backendRunLoop() now aborts immediately on SIGTERM
	  if no data has been written yet (STR #2103)
	- Due to poor IPP support from the vendors, the SNMP
	  backend no longer tries IPP connections; instead,
	  it now uses a lookup file with fallback to port 9100
	  (socket://address) and 515 (lpd://address) printing
	  (STR #2035, STR #2354) 
	- The scheduler now recreates the CUPS log directory as
	  needed (STR #2353)

	- The cupstestppd program now tests for existing filters,
	  icons, profiles, and dialog extensions (STR #2326)

	  with the list of printers.
	- The web interface now supports setting the banner and
	  policy options on raw printers and classes (STR #2238)

	  file (STR #1871)
	- Printers that use JCL options are now exported to Samba
	  correctly (STR #1985)
	- The IPP backend now relays printer-state-message values

	  device and multiple files and/or banners now works (STR
	  #1933)
	- Added new public cupsAdminGetServerSettings() and
	  cupsAdminSetServerSettings() APIs.
	- Added new "makebuttons" script in the "tools" directory
	  for creating web interface buttons (STR #2231)
	- Added support for DNS-SD (aka "Bonjour") printer sharing
	  (STR #1171)
	- Job operations (cancel, hold, release, etc.) from the

	  notify-lease-duration-default attributes can now be set
	  (STR #1671)

	  the "printer-defaults" attribute group is requested (STR
	  #1923)
	- Added support for Linux "relro" linker option (STR #1614)
	- CUPS now validates the number-up option value (STR #1329)
	- The on-line help now provides better search capabilities
	  (STR #1701)

	  to change the printer name, description,  and location
	  (STR #1646)

	  for basic device control and information queries (STR
	  #1898)
	- The scheduler now uses poll(), epoll(), or /dev/kqueue
	  instead of select() when possible (STR #1261)
	- Added new cupsArrayGetIndex() and cupsArrayGetInsert()
	  functions to get the current index and insertion
	  positions of an array.
	- Added a new --with-max-copies configure option (STR
	  #2090)

	  functions.

	  which specifies the character set that is used in PJL
	  strings (STR #1969)

	  http_t members will no longer compile!

	  attribute on a per-printer basis.
	- Added support for IntelliBar label printers.
