CHANGES IN CUPS V1.2.0b1

	- Local authentication certificates are now stored in
	  /var/run/cups/certs by default instead of
	  /etc/cups/certs (STR #1211)
	- Backends now use "&" to separate options in device
	  URIs; "+" is still recognized but is deprecated (STR
	  #842)
	- The USB backend no longer supports the usb:/dev/foo
	  format on systems that support device ID queries.
	- Forced classification markings did not work when the
	  job-sheets parameters were "none,none".
	- "lpstat -l -p" incorrectly showed all users as allowed,
	  even if the queue was restricted to certain users (STR
	  #801)
	- The scheduler now automatically detects SSL/TLS clients
	  without using the SSLPort/SSLListen directives.
	- The CUPS API and scheduler no longer support SSLv2-
	  encrypted connections.
	- Updated the cupsaddsmb utility to correctly export the
	  CUPS driver for Windows.
	- Fixed a signal-handling bug in httpRead() which
	  ultimately caused the server to print multiple copies
	  when it was busy (STR #1184)
	- The cupsFile API now uses the O_APPEND option when
	  opening files in append mode (STR #990)
	- The md5.h header and md5_* functions are now officially
	  private and have been renamed to avoid conflicts with
	  other implementations with the same name.
	- The pdftops filter incorrectly embedded some Type1
	  fonts (STR #1093)
	- The scheduler didn't detect a closed connection in the
	  middle of an IPP request (STR #1153)
	- The scheduler could block trying to read the job status
	  if there was input pending and the job was cancelled in
	  the same input cycle (STR #1157)
	- The scheduler could crash when deleting a class due to
	  infinite recursion.
	- Updated the Zebra ZPL label printer driver to use the
	  run-length encoding and support more options.
	- Updated serial backend to scan for /dev/ttyC* as well
	  as /dev/ttyc* for Cyclades serial ports (STR #1049)
	- The scheduler could hang reading the job status under
	  certain circumstances (STR #1068)
	- The USB backend termination signal code was inverted
	  (STR #1046)
	- Moved enable and disable commands to sbindir to be
	  consistent.
	- Updated pdftops filter to Xpdf 3.00.03.
	- Added new cupsRasterInterpretPPD() function for RIP
	  filters to setup the raster page header from
	  PostScript commands in a PPD file.
	- The CUPS browsing protocol now offers a "delete" bit
	  to remove printers as soon as they are deleted on the
	  server or as soon as the server shuts down gracefully
	  (STR #793)
	- The CUPS_SERVER and ServerName directives (client.conf
	  and ~/.cupsrc) may now contain names of the form
	  "server:port" and "/path/to/domain/socket".
	- The "cancel -u user" command now works for ordinary
	  users (STR #751)
	- Added test run support to "make test" target (STR #64)
	- Added domain socket support (STR #656)
	- Added BrowseLocalOptions directive to allow the
	  administrator to add printer URI options to the browse
	  URI, e.g. "encryption=required" (STR #732)
	- Added BrowseRemoteOptions directive to allow the
	  administrator to add standard URI options to the
	  remote printer URI, e.g. "encryption=required" (STR
	  #732)
	- Now put "-I.." compiler option in front of all others
	  to ensure that local CUPS headers are used before
	  installed headers (STR #437)
	- New cupsLangPrintf() and cupsLangPuts() for localized
	  interfaces.
	- Now support custom attributes and extended options in
	  PPD files.
	- Now provide functions to save PPD files.
	- New policy mechanism allows per-operation and
	  per-printer control over what users and groups are
	  allowed to do various IPP operations.
	- New error policy mechanism to control how aborted
	  backend errors are handled by the scheduler
	  (abort-job, retry-job, requeue-job, stop-printer)
	- Updated the printer test page with a better color
	  wheel and a separate grayscale ramp.
	- A single backend process is now run to send all print
	  data for a job.
	- Backends and filters can now send and receive
	  backchannel data over file descriptor 3.
	- Updated the raster stream format to support more
	  user-defined attributes and to do compression of the
	  page data.
