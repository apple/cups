CHANGES IN CUPS V1.2.0b1

	- Added BrowseLocalOptions directive to allow the
	  administrator to add printer URI options to the browse
	  URI, e.g. "encryption=required" (STR #732)
	- Added BrowseRemoteOptions directive to allow the
	  administrator to add standard URI options to the
	  remote printer URI, e.g. "encryption=required" (STR
	  #732)
	- Now put "-I.." compiler option in front of all others
	  to ensure that local CUPS headers are used before
	  installed headers (STR #437)
	- New cupsLangPrintf() and cupsLangPuts() for localized
	  interfaces.
	- Now support custom attributes and extended options in
	  PPD files.
	- Now provide functions to save PPD files.
	- New policy mechanism allows per-operation and
	  per-printer control over what users and groups are
	  allowed to do various IPP operations.
	- New error policy mechanism to control how aborted
	  backend errors are handled by the scheduler
	  (abort-job, retry-job, requeue-job, stop-printer)
	- Updated the printer test page with a better color
	  wheel and a separate grayscale ramp.
	- A single backend process is now run to send all print
	  data for a job.
	- Backends and filters can now send and receive
	  backchannel data over file descriptor 3.
	- Updated the raster stream format to support more
	  user-defined attributes and to do compression of the
	  page data.
