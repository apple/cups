	  reasons value when looking up the address and copying the print data

	  reason on all platforms.


CHANGES IN CUPS V1.4rc1

	- The PPD compiler documentation was missing information on localization
	  (STR #3212)
	- The IPP backend now reconnects after every request when talking to
	  printers that claim IPP support but only use HTTP/1.0.
	- The PPD compiler crashed when both "Resolution" and "Group foo Option
	  Resolution" were specified in the .drv file.
	- The PPD compiler's #if/#elif/#else/#endif did not work for undefined
	  variables (STR #3210)
	- Static libraries could not be installed by a non-root user on systems
	  needing a ranlib program (STR #3209)
	- The scheduler incorrectly always tried to copy Kerberos credentials
	  for print jobs.

	  users that were not authorized to do IPP operations (STR #3193)
	- The scheduler did not report more than 8 Product strings from a PPD
	  file.  Some PPD files have as many as 24.
	- ppdOpen*() could crash if a keyword had no value string (something
	  that cupstestppd looks for...)
	- cupsLangDefault() did not return the correct language on Mac OS X.
	- The Mac OS X USB backend did not handle aborted or stalled pipe
	  conditions properly, which prevented drivers from ejecting partial
	  pages when a job was canceled or held.


CHANGES IN CUPS V1.4b3

	  French, Italian, Korean, Norwegian, Portuguese, and Swedish
	  (STR #3096, STR #3098, STR #3109, STR #3111, STR #3141)
	- Updated the configure check for -fstack-protector (STR #3198)
	- The network backends now correctly convert SNMP supply descriptions to
	  UTF-8 encoding as needed.

        - Fixed a number of ppdi issues and added a unit test to validate that
	  ppdc + ppdi can generate and import the same data (STR #3152)
	- Moving jobs in the web interface now shows an error if you only have
	  one printer or class added (STR #3094)
	- Since classes have never truly supported the printer-error-policy

	  reality and support only the retry-current-job policy for now
	  (STR #3171)
	- Revised the password callback support (STR #2953)
	- ppdEmit*() did not choose between PageSize and PageRegion properly.
	- Make some fairly substantial changes to the Kerberos support code so
	  that CUPS can work in multi-realm environments and does not require
	  delegatable credentials.  Shared printing still requires delegation,
	  however "delegation by policy" can be enabled in the KDC to make this
	  all work.
	- "AccessLogLevel actions" did not hide client-error-not-found errors.
	- AP_FIRST_InputSlot did not work with number-up.
	- cupsBackChannelRead() and cupsBackChannelWrite() could fail due to a
	  lack of kernel buffers.
	- The IPP and LPD backends did not respond to side-channel requests
	  while copying print data to a temporary file.
	- cupsWriteRequestData() flushed the output buffer unnecessarily,
	  causing reduced performance in some situations.
	- If a CGI process died before sending its MIME headers, the request
	  would hang on the client.

	  work (STR #3132)

	  (configurable) to cancel or hold the job.
	- The cupstestppd program did not validate the capitalization of
	  filenames in the PPD file.
	- The cupstestppd program did not validate the PageSize and PageRegion
	  values.
	- The cups-deviced helper program could miss reporting some backend
	  devices (STR #3108)
	- The cupsSideChannelSNMP* functions did not work.
	- The scheduler could consume 100% CPU when jobs were canceled.

	  permissions.

	- The dnssd backend did not unquote "full names" before creating the
	  device URI.
	- The scheduler now supports JobRetryInterval values less than 10
	  seconds.
	- Updated the Spanish localization (STR #3090)

	  status operations.
	- ppdOpen*() incorrectly loaded PPDs with multiple JobPatchFile
	  keywords.
	- The network backends no longer report the SNMP "offline" or
	  maintenance status bits since they are inconsistently implemented and
	  often unreliable.
	- The scheduler no longer logs child processes killed via SIGKILL as
	  "crashed".
	- The printer link shown on the "job moved" template was bad (STR #3085)
	- Updated the HTML templates to use the final HTML 4 DOCTYPE (STR #3086)
	- The scheduler did not track the "paused" reason properly if a
	  printer had other reasons associated with it.
	- cupsSendRequest() did not clear old local certificate auth data.
	- The PPD compiler did not search for localization files properly
	  (STR #3084)
	- cupsGetNamedDest() did not use the fallback default like
	  cupsGetDests*() (STR #3082)
	- The scheduler now provides a LogTimeFormat directive to enable
	  microseconds in the date and time that are logged.
	- The scheduler now provides a MultipleOperationTimeout directive to
	  control the timeout for multi-file print jobs.
	- The configure script incorrectly allowed Avahi to be used for DNS-SD
	  printer discovery (STR #3065)

	- The scheduler incorrectly registered default profiles for PostScript
	  printers with no specified colorspace.
	- The scheduler incorrectly created an empty org.cups.printers.plist
	  file on Mac OS X.
	- cupsGetPPD3() did not look for local PPDs in the right directory.
	- SNMP lookups via side-channel did not work for NULL-VALUE and
	  and OCTET-STRING OIDs containing nul characters.
	- The libusb-based USB backend did not work.
	- The scheduler did not set the printer-commands attribute correctly
	  for some PPDs.
	- The ppdi utility did not work.
	- The web interface no longer uses multi-part output with old or broken
	  web browsers (STR #3049)
	- CUPS now conforms to the draft IPP/2.0 and IPP/2.1 specification.
	- Added a new cupsGetConflicts() API to get a list of conflicting
	  options.
	- The PPD compiler didn't localize options or choices that did not
	  have associated translation text (STR #3045)
	- Updated the Spanish localization (STR #3043)
	- Fixed build problems (STR #3040, STR #3047)
	- cupsResolveConflicts() did not resolve using the default option
	  choice in some cases due to the mirror UIConstraints that are
	  present in most PPD files.
	- The scheduler did not honor MIME type priorities.
	- The commandtops filter incorrectly used the JCLBegin code to end
	  its jobs.
	- The default BrowseLocalProtocols value was not set properly.
	- Since the commandtops filter does not actually support ReportLevels
	  all on its own, don't list that printer command by default for PS
	  printers.
	- The scheduler did not give filters a chance to log errors or update
	  printer attributes when a job was canceled.
	- The scheduler did not clear the "connecting-to-device" reason keyword
	  when a job finished.

        - The CUPS-Get-Devices operation now supports the include-schemes
	  attribute.
	- The print filters now support a replacement for the fitplot
