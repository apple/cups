CHANGES IN CUPS v1.1.3

	- Makefile fixes.
	- Documentation updates.
	- Enabled pstoraster debug messages for everything
	  (only logged when LogLevel set to "debug"...)
	- Changed the Input/OutputAttributes fix in
	  pstoraster so that it works on all platforms.
	- The HP-GL/2 filter didn't set the right green
	  color value in encoded polylines or text.
	- Updated the "fitplot" code to handle plot sizes
	  specified as "PSwidth,length" and "PSlength,width".
	- Updated the Linux parallel and USB backends to open
	  the device files prior to looking in /proc for
	  autoprobe info. This makes sure that loadable device
	  driver modules are in fact loaded...
	- Added new FilterLimit directive to limit the number
	  of processing jobs/filters on a system.
	- set-job-attributes didn't change the job-state to
	  held/pending when the job-hold-until attribute was
	  specified.
	- set-job-attributes didn't save the new job attributes.
	- Now change the "requesting-user-name" attribute in
	  requests from remote systems to "root-remote" when
	  an unauthenticated "root" user is sent.
	- The cancel-job, hold-job, release-job, and restart-job
	  operations didn't log the authenticated username.
	- The cups-lpd mini-daemon now checks for a
	  document-format option before forcing raw mode with
	  filter mode 'l'.
	- The cups-lpd mini-daemon now supports "-o" options
	  on the command-line (passed by inetd) to set global
	  defaults for all print queues.
	- The pstops filter assumed that a file with a Trailer
	  comment would also have an EOF comment.
	- Added new cupsSetPasswordCB(), cupsSetServer(),
	  cupsSetUser(), and ippSetPort() functions to better
	  support client applications (especially GUIs...)
	- The CUPS-add-class and CUPS-add-printer operations
	  didn't reset the printer-name attribute on remote
	  print queues that had to be renamed when a local
	  printer was defined with the same name.
	- The lpoptions command now supports a "-r" option to
	  remove options for a printer or instance.
	- The lpadmin and admin.cgi programs no longer allow
	  class and printer names to begin with a number; this
	  caused the command-line utilities to become confused.
	- The Linux USB backend now looks for both the parallel
	  and usblp driver names in the device list.
	- Added a new FontPath directive to cupsd.conf, and also
	  a "--with-fontpath" option for the configure script to
	  specify alternate font paths for pstoraster.
	- The CUPS-move-job operation didn't update the
	  job-printer-uri attribute.
	- The scheduler only looked up printers and classes by
	  name in IPP requests, instead of using the full URI.
	  This caused problems with KUPS and friends with
	  remote printers.
	- The scheduler now handles better localization of
	  hostnames (e.g. server is host.foo.com, remote is
	  host.subfoo.foo.com, localized is not host.subfoo...)
	- The scheduler logging functions now use a common
	  log file checking/rotation function (courtesy of
	  Crutcher Dunnavant at Red Hat)
	- The scheduler could accept more client connections
	  than it allocated for if more than one Port or Listen
	  line was present in cupsd.conf.
	- Other minor scheduler performance tweeks.
	- The lpq and lprm commands didn't support the default
	  printer set using lpoptions.
	- The lpoptions command now supports a "-l" option to
	  list the printer-specific options and their current
	  settings.


CHANGES IN CUPS v1.1.2

	- Makefile/configure fixes
	- RPM spec file and EPM list file fixes
	- The cupsTempFile() function now uses a different
	  algorithm for generating temp files and "reserves"
	  them to avoid possible security exploitation.
	- Now use /dev/random (if available) to seed the random
	  number generator for certificates.
	- The /var/spool/cups and /var/spool/cups/tmp directories
	  were incorrectly owned by root; they are now owned by
	  the filter user, typically "lp".
	- The scheduler now resets the permissions on the spool
	  and temp directories as needed to match the filter
	  user.
	- Now expose ppdCollect() as an externally callable
	  function.
	- The image filters now support filtering from the
	  standard input.
	- The imagetoraster filter now collects all printer
	  options and job patch files and applies them to the
	  page header as needed.
	- Added format and banner options to LPD backend.
	- The send-document operation didn't start a job
	  immediately when last-document was true.
	- The set-job-attributes operation didn't correctly
	  replace the current job-hold-until value.
	- Removed the option wrapper code from ppdEmit() and
	  friends since it caused problems with Ghostscript
	  and many PS printers.
	- Was setting TZ environment variable twice for job
	  filters.
	- Added syslog logging in cups-lpd to aide in
	  debugging problems.
	- The HP-UX parallel port backend did not list the
	  available parallel ports on some systems (printf
	  calling problem...)
	- The lp and lpr commands overrode user options if
	  -d/-P were specified after -o.
	- The scheduler would crash with a */* filter.
	- Added support for a "default" filter for unknown file
	  types.  The example provided in the mime.types and
	  mime.convs file prints unknown files as if "-oraw" was
	  specified for the job.  This functionality is disabled
	  by default.
	- The "compatibility" mode fix for older backends did not
	  work for smbspool.  Added a workaround for it.
	- The HP-GL/2 filter didn't perform the right pen scaling
	  with some files and the "fitplot" option.
	- New Software Performance Specification document that
	  describes the memory, disk, and CPU usage of all the
	  CUPS software.


CHANGES IN CUPS v1.1.1

	- The pstoraster Makefile still referenced one of the
	  old PDF filter files.
	- The filter Makefile used INSTALL_DATA instead of
	  INSTALL_LIB to install the CUPS image library.
	- The administration CGI didn't work properly with
	  network devices.
	- The BrowseACL variable was not updated after the
	  cupsd.conf file was loaded.
	- The lpd mini-daemon didn't support printer instances.
	- Now use a default umask of 077 for child processes.
	- Now put temp files in /var/spool/cups/tmp for child
	  processes and the root user, unless TMPDIR or TempDir
	  is defined otherwise.
	- cupsGetPPD() no longer uses easy-to-guess filenames.
	- The CUPS-Delete-Class and CUPS-Delete-Printer
	  operations now save classes.conf file as needed.
	- The lppasswd command wouldn't add a user.
	- The ppdOpen() function could cause a segfault if a
	  0-length PPD file was read.
	- The image filters were not handling images with
	  different X and Y resolutions properly.
	- The imagetoraster filter defaulted to RGB output
	  instead of black output like pstoraster.
	- The pstops filter didn't handle binary data properly.
	- The pstops filter didn't handle copies properly for
	  PS files lacking DSC comments.
	- The pstops filter now appends %%EOF to the end of
	  documents if they don't have it.
	- The cupsGetPPD() function didn't work with remote
	  printers lacking the @server in the name.
	- The configure script didn't work right when only
	  --prefix was specified.
	- The ppdEmit() code now wraps all printer commands so
	  that buggy PostScript printers will still print a file
	  after receiving an option that isn't available.
	- Fixed the DeskJet margin bug, and disabled 600dpi
	  color mode until it can be fixed.
	- The cupsAddDest() function didn't sort instances
	  correctly in all cases.
	- The time-at-xyz attributes now expand to the date and
	  time in banner files.


CHANGES IN CUPS v1.1

	- Documentation updates.
	- Configuration script updates.
	- Didn't map charset and language value strings to lowercase
	  and _ to - as required by SLP and IPP.
	- ppdLoadXYZ() didn't add the list of available fonts to the
	  ppd_file_t structure.
	- The text filter common code was freeing the PPD file data
	  before it was used.
	- The text filter now embeds missing fonts.
	- The CGI interface now maps local access to the server to
	  the localhost address.
	- The HP-GL/2 filter didn't use the specified (or default)
	  color ranges, resulting in strange colors.
	- The HP-GL/2 filter didn't default to no input window, which
	  caused unnecessary clipping of plots.
	- Integrated Xpdf's pdftops filter into CUPS, which is a
	  lightweight and reliable replacement for Ghostscript's
	  PDF support.
	- Removed all PDF support from Ghostscript.
	- Updated HP driver to set top margin; this seems to fix
	  the offset problem seen on HP DeskJet printers.
	- Fixed dependencies on the ZLIB and JPEG libraries in
	  pstoraster.
	- The lpr command wasn't using the lpoptions defined by
	  the user.
	- The lpr command would segfault if the CUPS server was
	  not running.
	- The top-level makefile was not installing the CUPS
	  initialization script.  It now does so if it sees there
	  is an init.d directory in /sbin, /etc/rc.d, or /etc.
	- "lpstat -v all" didn't work.
	- pstoraster would crash on some platforms doing the
	  setpagedevice operator.
	- The web administration interface now allows you to set
	  the default banner pages.
	- Images can now be positioned on the page using the new
	  "position" option.
	- The AccessLog, ErrorLog, and PageLog directives now
	  support "%s" to insert the server name.
	- Added a new BrowseShortNames directive to allow for
	  short remote printer names ("printer" instead of
	  "printer@server") when possible.
	- The scheduler could crash if given an invalid PPD file
	  with no PageSize attributes.
	- Updated the serial, parallel, and usb backends to do
	  multiple writes and ignore ioctl() errors as needed;
	  this should fix problems with serial printing on old
	  serial drivers and with the UltraSPARC parallel port
	  driver under Solaris 2.7.
	- Now propagate LD_LIBRARY_PATH to child processes from
	  cupsd.
	- New DataDir directive for installing in alternate
	  locations.
	- New CUPS_SERVERROOT and CUPS_DATADIR environment
	  variables to specify installation directories as
	  needed.
	- Queued remote jobs recreate remote printers as needed
	  when the scheduler is started.
	- Deleting a printer also purges all jobs on that
	  printer.
	- Old job and control files that don't belong to a
	  printer are automatically deleted.
	- Wasn't updating time-at-processing and
	  time-at-completed attributes in job.
	- Didn't send required multiple-operation-time-out
	  attribute in response to a get-printer-attributes
	  request.
	- cups-lpd now supports options set with lpoptions.
	- The job-hold-until attribute is now provided with all
	  jobs. For jobs that are not currently held the value
	  is "no-hold".
	- The scheduler was not sending "unknown" values in IPP
	  responses.
	- The lpoptions command now accumulates options from
	  previous runs rather than replacing all options for a
	  printer.
	- The IPP backend now switches to IPP/1.0 if a 1.1
	  request fails.
	- The lpadmin and admin.cgi programs now validate new
	  printer and class names.
	- The access_log file now includes the number of IPP bytes
	  received in a POST request.


CHANGES IN CUPS v1.1b5

	- Documentation updates.
	- The pstoraster filter didn't compile without the JPEG library.
	- The cupsd server didn't support the HTTP OPTIONS request
	  method.
	- Dropped the "CLOSE" method supported by the cupsd server.
	  (not defined in HTTP specification)
	- Makefile/configure script fixes.
	- Missing the job-restart template.
	- Added IPP test suite for testing.
	- Missing IPP documentation from binary distributions.
	- Fixed multiple-document handling code when last-document
	  not specified.
	- Added more checks to IPP requests to prevent bad requests
	  from getting through.
	- Not all of the Ghostscript error output was being sent to
	  stderr.
	- The PostScript filter now added PJL commands to set the
	  job name and display string, if supported.
	- The scheduler would crash if the browse socket could not
	  be bound. Now disables browsing if port 631 (reserved for
	  IPP) is being used by a misbehaving daemon.
	- The USB backend now looks for the older Linux 2.2.x USB
	  printer device filenames as well as the newer ones.
	- The IPP backend now uses the UTF-8 charset exclusively,
	  since apparently only CUPS handles more than US-ASCII and
	  UTF-8...
	- Wasn't quoting ( in PostScript banners...
	- Send-document requests with no document-format attribute
	  could cause cupsd to crash.
	- Old jobs in the spool directory might cause cupsd to
	  crash.
	- CUPS now supports all of the recommended job-hold-until
	  keywords as well as name values of the form "HH:MM" and
	  "HH:MM:SS".
	- Added placeholder pointer for TLS encryption to the HTTP
	  connection structure.
	- Fixed the "fast poll" bug reported by DISA - the
	  status pipe wasn't being closed for multi-file jobs.
	- Revamped put_params code in pstoraster to fix bitmap
	  allocation bug with FrameMaker output.
	- Ripped out filename, etc. code from pstoraster as it
	  is a potential security hole.
	- Added support for RIP_CACHE environment variable in the
	  new pstoraster.
	- Fixed USB device filenames for Linux; now support new
	  pre-2.4 devices (/dev/usb/lp#) and 2.2 devices
	  (/dev/usblp#)
	- Fixed accept-jobs crash with classes.
	- Didn't include dot-matrix EPSON drivers in previous
	  release.


CHANGES IN CUPS v1.1b4

	- Documentation updates.
	- Many makefile and configuration script fixes (should
	  now compile better under *BSD.)
	- The MediaPosition attribute was being mishandled by
	  GhostScript, causing the RIP to fail whenever a paper
	  tray was selected.
	- The scheduler now logs the final line of log information
	  from a filter, even if it doesn't end with a newline; this
	  primarily affects GhostScript error output.
	- The scheduler was saving implicit classes, so after a few
	  restarts you'll end up with AnyPrinter, AnyAnyPrinter, etc.
	- The JPEG autodetection didn't work with some JPEG files that
	  came from digital cameras (JPEG but not JFIF); the new
	  magic types should work with all images that the JPEG library
	  can handle.
	- Fixed a bug in the new contains() MIME type rule that could
	  cause cupsd to crash.
	- Switched to using strtol() in the MIME type code so that you
	  can use hex, octal, or decimal constants as desired in the
	  mime.types file.
	- Banner files are now treated as templates, allowing any type
	  of file to be used as a banner.
	- Added a 30-second timeout to backend device reports so that a
	  hung backend will not prevent the scheduler from starting.
	- Backends are once again terminated when jobs are stopped; the
	  CUPS-supplied backends will stay alive until the downstream
	  filters have had a chance to clear out old page data.
	- The charset lookup in the CUPS localization support was wrong
	  (iso8859-x instead of iso-8859-x)
	- Changed the "cpNNNN" code page files to "windows-NNNN" to match
	  the IANA registrations.
	- New PostScript banner pages.
	- Added Windows BMP and Alias PIX image file support to the image
	  filter.
	- The PNG reading coded didn't free all of its buffers.
	- Added Digest authentication support to the client and server
	  code.
	- Added Solaris options to System V commands.
	- Now support the output-bin job template attribute.
	- Now log the job-billing attribute in the page_log file, and
	  keep track of the total number of pages in the
	  job-media-sheets-completed attribute.
	- The penwidth option is now in micrometers to support more
	  accurate width specification.
	- The image filters now support interlaced and transparent PNG
	  files.
	- Didn't handle Keep-Alive for HTTP/1.0 clients.
	- The BrowsePoll support didn't handle when BrowseInterval
	  was set to 0 (now uses 30 seconds if BrowseInterval is 0)
	- The DeskJet driver now supports 600 DPI color for printers
	  that support it.
	- New lpinfo and lpmove commands.
	- The lpq command now supports the Digital UNIX output format.
	- The LPD mini-daemon now supports all required LPD operations.
	- Implemented timeouts for multi-file documents.
	- New cupsPrintFiles() function in the CUPS API library to
	  print multiple files using create-job and send-document
	  requests (1 job ID for multiple files)
	- The lp command now sends multiple files as a single job,
	  matching the behavior of the System V command.
	- The "cancel -a" command now purges job history files.


CHANGES IN CUPS v1.1b3

	- Documentation updates.
	- The startup script redirected stderr before stdout,
	  which caused problems with some versions of Bourne
	  shell and Bash.
	- Fixed a bug in the scheduler's PPD language reading
	  code.
	- Fixed a bug in the scheduler's check for the
	  manufacturer in the PPD.
	- The pstoraster filter didn't allow some input and
	  output attributes to be set.
	- Added banner page support.
	- Added missing PAM configuration file.
	- Configuration script fixes for Linux and *BSD.
	- The log file code was using the wrong sign for the
	  timezone offset.
	- The default printcap file is now empty (no printcap
	  file is generated).
	- The scheduler did not start jobs destined for remote
	  printers when they became available.
	- The scheduler now sends jobs to remote printers
	  immediately. (when sending jobs to a class, the remote
	  printer is only used when it becomes available)
	- The scheduler now supports printing of banner pages
	  via the job-sheets attribute (banner files go in
	  /usr/share/cups/banners)
	- The cupsd process now forks itself into the background
	  (override with -f)
	- Added several *BSD enhancements.
	- Added UNSUPPORTED libtool option to configuration
	  script to allow the use of libtool.  Note that this is
	  UNSUPPORTED by us, but added by request of the *BSD
	  folks.
	- The parallel, serial, and usb backends now retry the
	  opening of their ports.  This allows multiple print
	  queues to be associated with a single physical port,
	  and will allow CUPS to support several types of
	  parallel port auto-switches in the near future.
	- Set-Job-Attributes now supports adding, changing, and
	  deleting job template attributes, and no longer allows
	  job-printer-uri to be set (see CUPS-Move-Job)
	- Added CUPS-Move-Job operation to support moving of jobs.
	- The CGI template functionality now supports multiple
	  languages (still only have templates for English)
	- The CUPS-Get-Printers and CUPS-Get-Classes operations
	  now support filtering as defined in the IDD.
	- The Get-Jobs, CUPS-Get-Printers, and CUPS-Get-Classes
	  operations no longer limit themselves to 1000 jobs,
	  printers, or classes (believe it or not, this is
	  needed for some sites)
	- The web interfaces now support language-specific
	  templates.
	- The web admin interface now supports class management.
	- The web admin interface now shows a list of
	  manufacturers before selecting the PPD/driver for a
	  specific printer.
	- The web admin interface now supports configuration of
	  the default printer options in the PPD file.
	- The web interface now uses printer/class
	  authentication for the test page instead of admin
	  authentication.
	- Updated the RPM spec file for the current release.
	- Updated language support for Windows code pages.
	- 8-bit character set files can now use multiple fonts
	  (needed for Arabic, Greek, Hebrew, etc.)
	- Added basic right-to-left text support in the text
	  filter.
	- The POSIX locale now uses ISO-8859-1 instead of
	  US-ASCII.
	- Fixed PDF printing problems.
	- Fixed PostScript RIP page device dictionary elements
	  that weren't getting passed in cups_get_params().
	- Added a new "contains" rule for the magic file typing.
	- The "printable" rule now accepts characters from 128 to 255
	  (needed for Microsoft character sets)
	- Added support for ~/.cupsrc as well as /etc/cups/client.conf
	  so that the default server can be configured on a per-user
	  basis without environment variables.
	- Added LPD mini-daemon to support incoming LPD jobs.


CHANGES IN CUPS v1.1b2

	- Documentation updates.
	- The lp command didn't always load the user-defined
	  destinations, preventing it from seeing the default
	  printer.
	- Many configure script and makefile fixes.
	- The Microsoft code page files were missing from the
	  distribution.
	- Added a workaround for the HP IPP client (which is sending
	  an invalid printer-uri in requests)
	- Fixed the encoding of text-with-language and name-with-language
	  to match the IPP spec.
	- Added support for unknown value tags in the IPP routines
	  (previously they would be ignored)
	- Integrated GNU GhostScript 5.50 into the pstoraster filter.
	- Client hostname resolution was broken on little-endian
	  machines.
	- Now look at client.conf file for client's default server
	  and printer.
	- The cupsServer() function did not close the client.conf file
	  if it contained a ServerName directive.
	- Added BrowseAllow, BrowseDeny, BrowseOrder, BrowsePoll, and
	  BrowseRelay directives.
	- BrowseInterval 0 disables advertising of local printers, but
	  still receives information on remote printers.
	- New browse polling daemon (for polling servers on different
	  networks)
	- New PPD cache file for faster startup times with large numbers
	  of PPD files.
	- The Host: field was incorrectly required for HTTP/1.0 clients.
	- New set-job-attributes operation now supported.
	- The mime_load_types() and mime_load_convs() functions did not
	  close their input files.


CHANGES IN CUPS v1.1b1

	- NEW web-based administration interface.
	- NEW EPSON printer drivers.
	- NEW user-defined printers and options.
	- NEW persistent jobs and job history
	- NEW IPP/1.1 support
	- NEW template-based web interfaces.
	- NEW CUPS-get-devices and CUPS-get-ppds operations.
	- NEW support for create-job and send-file operations.
	- NEW certificate-based authentication for local
	      administration.
	- NEW USB backend.
	- The lpr command now produces human-readable error messages.
	- The lpq command now produces BSD standard format output
	  instead of OSF/1 output.  This should resolve the SAMBA
	  print queue problems that have been reported.
	- The IPP backend did not always detect when the "raw" option
	  was being used.
	- The "lpstat -p" command would stop after the first active
	  printer.
	- The "lpstat -v" command would stop before the first remote
	  printer.


CHANGES IN CUPS v1.0.5

	- The HP-GL/2 filter did not correctly set the pen color
          for pens other than #1.
	- The scheduler would only accept 26 simultaneous jobs
          under some OS releases (mkstemp() limitation.)  It now
          handles up to 2^32 simultaneous jobs.
	- The PostScript filter loaded the printer's PPD file
          twice.
	- The PAM authentication code now uses pam_strerror() to
          provide a textual error message in the error_log file.
	- The scheduler now copies PPD and interface script
          files instead of moving them; this fixes installations
          with a separate requests directory.
	- The PostScript RIP did not generate correct 6-color
          output.
	- Several filters were marking PPD options twice when
          they didn't need to.
	- The scheduler did not save the printer or class state
          after an accept-jobs or reject-jobs operation.
	- The cupsGetDefault() function now ignores the PRINTER
          environment variable if it is set to "lp".
	- New ippErrorString() function to get textual error
          messages.
	- Better error reporting in the System V commands.
	- The lpadmin and lpstat commands always tried to
          connect to the default server.
	- The text filter didn't load the charset files from the
          correct location.
	- Wasn't sending a WWW-Authenticate: field to HTTP
          clients when authentication was required.
	- httpSeparate() didn't always set the default port
          number for known methods.
	- The HP-GL/2 filter now looks for "PSwidth,length"
          instead of (the correct) "PSlength,width" as
          documented by HP.  It appears that many major CAD
          applications are broken and this change allows the
          auto-rotation to work with them.
	- The IPP "printer-resolution" option was not being
          translated.
	- The charset files did not include the Microsoft
          "standard" characters from 128 to 159 (unused by the
          ISO-8859-x charsets)
	- The scheduler was chunking the Content-Type field from
          CGI programs; this problem was most noticeable with
          Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.
	- By popular demand, the printers, jobs, and classes
          CGIs no longer force a reload of the page every 10/30
          seconds.
	- The scheduler incorrectly required that the IPP client
          provide a document-format attribute for the
          validate-job operation.
	- Clients that sent bad IPP requests without the
          required attributes-natural-language and
          attributes-charset attributes would crash the
          scheduler.


CHANGES IN CUPS v1.0.4

	- Documentation updates.
	- Jobs would get stuck in the queue and wouldn't print
	  until you enabled the queue.
	- The lp and lpr commands now catch SIGHUP and SIGINTR.
	- The lp and lpr commands now use sigaction or sigset

	- CUPS library updates for WIN32/OS-2


CHANGES IN CUPS v1.0.3

	- Documentation updates.
	- The lpq man page was missing.
	- The configure script was not properly detecting the
	  image libraries.
	- The top-level makefile was calling "make" instead of
	  "$(MAKE)".
	- PostScript filter fixes for number-up, OutputOrder,
	  and %Trailer.
	- The imagetops filter didn't end the base-85 encoding
	  properly if the image data was not a multiple of 4
	  bytes in length.
	- The imagetoraster filter didn't generate good banded
	  RGB or CMY data (was dividing the line width by 4
	  instead of 3...)
	- The imagetoraster filter now records the bounding
	  box of the image on the page.
	- The CUPS image library cache code wasn't working as
	  designed; images larger than the maximum RIP cache
	  would eventually thrash using the same cache tile.
	- The CUPS image library TIFF loading code didn't
	  handle unknown resolution units properly; the fixed
	  code uses a default resolution of 128 PPI.
	- cupsGetClasses() and cupsGetPrinters() did not free
	  existing strings if they ran out of memory.
	- The scheduler logs incorrectly contained 3 digits for
	  the timezone offset instead of 4.
	- The scheduler now does a lookup for the default user
	  and group ID; the previous hardcoded values caused
	  problems with the LPD backend.
	- The cancel-job operation now allows any user in the
	  system group to cancel any job.
	- The cancel-job operation stopped the print queue if
	  the job was being printed.
	- Now only stop printers if the backend fails. If the
	  filter fails then the failure is noted in the
	  error_log and printing continues with the next file in
	  the queue.
	- Now log whether a filter fails because of a signal
	  or because it returned a non-zero exit status.
	- The root user now always passes the system group test.
	- Printers with an interface script and remote printers
	  and classes didn't have a printer-make-and-model
	  attribute.
	- Added logging of lost/timed-out remote printers.
	- The HP-GL/2 filter was scaling the pen width twice.
	- Updated the HP-GL/2 filter to use a single SP (Set
	  Pen) procedure.  This makes the output smaller and is
	  more appropriate since the filter keeps track of the
	  pen states already.
	- The scheduler didn't handle passwords with spaces.
	- The IPP backend now does multiple copies and retries
	  if the destination server requires it (e.g. HP
	  JetDirect.)
	- The disable command didn't implement the "-c" option
	  (cancel all jobs.)
	- Changed the CMYK generation function for the image file
	  and PostScript RIPs.
	- The lp command didn't support the "-h" option as
	  documented.
	- The AppSocket, IPP, and LPD backends now retry on all
	  network errors.  This should prevent stopped queues
	  caused by a printer being disconnected from the
	  network or powered off.
	- The scheduler now restarts a job if the corresponding
	  printer is modified.
	- The image RIPs now rotate the image if needed to fit
	  on the page.


CHANGES IN CUPS v1.0.2

	- The HP-GL/2 filter didn't always scale the output
	  correctly.
	- The HP-GL/2 filter now supports changing the page size
	  automatically when the "fitplot" option is not used.
	- The cancel-job operation was expecting a resource name
	  of the form "/job/#" instead of "/jobs/#"; this
	  prevented the cancel and lprm commands from working.
	- The backends didn't log pages when files were printed
	  using the "-oraw" option.
	- The authorization code did not work with the Slackware
	  long shadow password package because its crypt() can
	  return NULL.
	- The chunking code didn't work for reading the response
	  of a POST request.
	- cupsGetPPD() now does authentication as needed.
	- The N-up code in the PostScript filter didn't work
	  with some printers (grestoreall would restore the
	  default blank page and device settings).
	- The N-up code in the PostScript filter didn't scale
	  the pages to fit within the imageable area of the
	  page.
	- Wasn't doing an fchown() on the request files.  This
	  caused problems when the default root account group
	  and CUPS group were not the same.


CHANGES IN CUPS v1.0.1

	- Documentation updates.
	- Fixed a bunch of possible buffer-overflow conditions.
	- The scheduler now supports authentication using PAM.
	- Updated the Italian message file.
	- httpEncode64() didn't add an extra "=" if there was
	  only one byte in the last three-byte group.
	- Now drop any trailing character set from the locale
	  string (e.g. "en_US.ISO_8859-1" becomes "en_US")
	- Fixed "timezone" vs "tm_gmtoff" usage for BSD-based
	  operating systems.
	- Updated IPP security so that "get" operations can be
	  done from any resource name; this allows the CGIs to
	  work with printer authentication enabled so long as
	  authentication isn't turned on for the whole "site".
	- The IPP code didn't properly handle the "unsupported"
	  group; this caused problems with the HP JetDirect since
	  it doesn't seem to support the "copies" attribute.
	- The HTTP chunking code was missing a CR LF pair at the
	  end of a 0-length chunk.
	- The httpSeparate() function didn't handle embedded
	  usernames and passwords in the URI properly.
	- Doing "lpadmin -p printer -E" didn't restart printing
	  if there were pending jobs.
	- The cancel-job operation now requires either a
	  requesting-user-name attribute or an authenticated
	  username.
	- The add-printer code did not report errors if the
	  interface script or PPD file could not be renamed.
	- Request files are now created without world read
	  permissions.
	- Added a cupsLastError() function to the CUPS API to
	  retrieve the IPP error code from the last request.
	- Options are now case-insensitive.
	- The lpq command now provides 10 characters for the
	  username instead of the original (Berkeley standard)
	  7.
	- The cancel command needed a local CUPS server to work
	  (or the appropriate ServerName in cupsd.conf)
	- The cancel and lprm commands didn't report the IPP
	  error if the job could not be cancelled.
	- The lp and lpr commands didn't intercept SIGTERM to
	  remove temporary files when printing from stdin.
	- The lp and lpr commands didn't report the IPP error if
	  the job could not be printed.
