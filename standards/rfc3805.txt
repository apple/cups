1.  Introduction

1.1.  Network Printing Environment

   The management of producing a printed document, in any computer
   environment, is a complex subject.  Basically, the task can be
   divided into two overlapping pieces, the management of printing and
   the management of the printer.  Printing encompasses the entire
   process of producing a printed document from generation of the file
   to be printed, selection of a printer, choosing printing properties,
   routing, queuing, resource management, scheduling, and final printing
   including notifying the user.  Most of the printing process is
   outside the scope of the model presented here; only the management of
   the printer is covered.

1.2.  Printer Device Overview

   A printer is the physical device that takes media from an input
   source, produces marks on that media according to some page
   description or page control language and puts the result in some
   output destination, possibly with finishing applied.  Printers are
   complex devices that consume supplies, produce waste and may have
   mechanical problems.  In the management of the physical device the
   description, status and alert information concerning the printer and
   its various subparts has to be made available to the management
   application so that it can be reported to the end user, key operators
   for the replenishment of supplies or the repair or maintenance of the
   device.  The information needed in the management of the physical
   printer and the management of a printing job overlap highly and many
   of the tasks in each management area require the same or similar
   information.

1.3.  Categories of Printer Information

   Information about printers is classified into three basic categories:
   descriptions, status and alerts.

1.3.1.  Descriptions

   Descriptions convey information about the configuration and
   capabilities of the printer and its various sub-units.  This
   information is largely static information and does not generally
   change during the operation of the system but may change as the
   printer is repaired, reconfigured or upgraded.  The descriptions are
   one part of the visible state of the printer where state means the
   condition of being of the printer at any point in time.

1.3.2.  Status

   Status is the information regarding the current operating state of
   the printer and its various sub-units.  As an example of the use of
   status, a management application must be able to determine if the
   various sub-units are ready to print or are in some state that
   prevents printing or may prevent printing in the future.

1.3.3.  Alerts

   An Alert is the representation of a reportable event in the printer.
   An event is a change in the state of the printer.  Some of those
   state changes are of interest to a management application and are
   therefore reportable.  Typically, these are the events that affect
   the printer's ability to print.  Alerts usually occur asynchronously
   to the operation of the computer system(s) to which the printer is



Bergman, et al.             Standards Track                     [Page 6]

RFC 3805                     Printer MIB v2                    June 2004


   attached. For convenience below, "alert" will be used for both the
   event caused by a change in the printer's state and for the
   representation of that event.

   Alerts can be classified into two basic categories, critical and non-
   critical.  A critical alert is one that is triggered by entry into a
   state in which the printer is stopped and printing can not continue
   until the condition that caused the critical alert is eliminated.
   "Out of paper", "toner empty" and "output bin full" are examples of
   critical alerts.  Non-critical alerts are triggered by those events
   that enter a state in which printing is not stopped.  Such a non-
   critical state may, at some future time, lead to a state in which
   printing may be stopped.  Examples of these kinds of non-critical
   alerts are "input media low", "toner low" and "output bin nearly
   full".  Or, a non-critical alert may simply provide information, such
   as signaling a configuration changed in the printer.

   Description, status and alert information about the printer can be
   thought of as a database describing the printer.  The management
   application for a printer will want to view the printer data base
   differently depending on how and for what purposes the information in
   the database is needed.

1.4.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

1.5.  Requirement Levels

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Compliant implementations must follow this specification.

2.  Printer Model

   In order to accomplish the management of the printer, an abstract
   model of the printer is needed to represent the sub-units from which
   the printer is composed.  A printer can be described as consisting of
   13 types of sub-units.  It is important to note that the sub-units of
   a printer do not necessarily relate directly to any physically
   identifiable mechanism.  Sub-units can also be a set of definable
   logical processes, such as interpreters for page description
   languages or command processors that set various operating modes of
   the printer.

   Figure 2 shows a block diagram of the printer and its basic 13 sub-
   units.

2.1.  Overview of the Printer Model

   The model has three basic parts: (1) the flow of a print file into an
   interpreter and onto the marker, (2) the flow of media through the
   marker and (3) the auxiliary sub-units that control and facilitate
   the two prior flows.  The flow of the print data comes through a
   physical connection on which some form of transport protocol stack is
   running.  The data provided by the transport protocol (interface)
   appears on a channel, which is the input to an interpreter.  The
   interpreter converts the print data into a form suitable for marking
   on the media.

   The media resides in Input sub-units from which the media is selected
   and then transported via a Media Path first to a Marking sub-unit and
   then onto an Output sub-unit with (optionally) some finishing
   operations being performed.  The auxiliary sub-units facilitate
   control of the printer, inquiry/control of the operator panel,
   reporting of alerts and the adaptation of the printer to various
   natural languages and characters sets.  All the software sub-units
   run on the System Controller that represents the processor, memory
   and storage systems of the Printer.  Each of the sub-units is
   discussed in more detail below.

   All of the sub-units other than the Alerts report only state
   information, either a description or a status.  The Alerts sub-unit
   reports event information.

2.2.  Printer Sub-Units

   A printer is composed of 13 types of sub-units, called groups.  The
   following sections describe the different types of sub-units.

2.2.1.  General Printer

   The general printer sub-unit is responsible for the overall control
   and status of the printer.  There is exactly one general printer sub-
   unit in a printer.  The General Printer Group in the model represents
   the general printer sub-unit.  In addition to the providing the
   status of the whole printer and allowing the printer to be reset,
   this Group provides information on the status of the packaging of the
   printer, in particular, the covers.  The general printer sub-unit is
   usually implemented on the system controller.

2.2.1.1.  International Considerations

   The localization portion of the general printer sub-unit is
   responsible for identifying the natural language, country, and
   character set in which certain character strings are expressed in



Bergman, et al.             Standards Track                    [Page 10]

RFC 3805                     Printer MIB v2                    June 2004


   this MIB.  Character sets are identified in this MIB using the
   IANACharset textual convention imported from the IANA Character Set
   MIB [CHARMIB].

   There may be one or more localizations supported per printer.  The
   available localizations are specified in the Localization table.
   Localization SHOULD only be performed on string objects which are
   named 'xxxDescription' (sub-unit descriptions) or
   'prtConsoleDisplayBufferText' (local console text).

   The agent SHALL return all other character strings in coded character
   sets in which code positions 0-127 (decimal) are US-ASCII [ASCII].
   The agent SHOULD return all other character strings in the UTF-8
   [RFC3629] transform of ISO 10646 [ISO10646], to conform with the IETF
   Policy on Character Sets and Languages [RFC2277].  Control codes
   (code positions 0-31 and 127 decimal) SHALL NOT be used unless
   specifically required in the DESCRIPTION of an object.

   The character set portion of the general printer Localization table
   is responsible for identifying the possible character sets for the
   operator console, and network management requests for display
   objects.  There may be one or more character sets per printer.
   Default coded character sets for interpreter unit and output octets
   are described in the interpreter sub-unit by
   prtInterpreterDefaultCharSetIn and prtInterpreterDefaultCharSetOut.
   These input/output character sets may be overridden by commands in
   the interpreter language itself.

2.2.2.  Inputs

   Input sub-units are mechanisms that feed media to be marked on into
   the printer.  A printer contains one or more input sub-units.  The
   Input Group in the model represents these.  The model does not
   distinguish fixed input bins from removable trays, except to report
   when a removable tray has been removed.

   There are as many input sub-units as there are distinctly selectable
   input "addresses".  For example, if one tray has both a manual and
   auto feeding option, then this is two input sub-units if these two
   sources can be (must be) separately selected.  However, the above
   would be considered one input sub-unit if putting a sheet in the
   manual feed slot overrides feeding from the contents of the tray.  In
   the second case there is no way to separately select or address the
   manual feed slot.

RFC 3805                     Printer MIB v2                    June 2004


2.2.3.  Media

   An input sub-unit can hold one or more instances of the media on
   which marking is to be done.  Typically, there is a large set of
   possible media that can be associated with an input.  The Media Group
   is an extension of the Input Group, which represents media in an
   input sub-unit.  The Media Group only describes the current contents
   of each input and not the possible content of the input sub-unit.

2.2.4.  Outputs

   Output sub-units are mechanisms that receive media that has been
   marked on.  The Output Group in the model represents the one or more
   output mechanisms contained by a printer.  The model does not
   distinguish fixed output bins from removable output bins, except to
   report when a removable bin has been removed.

   There are as many output sub-units as there are distinctly selectable
   output "addresses".  Output sub-units can be addressed in two
   different ways: (1) as a set of "mailboxes" which are addressed by a
   specific mailbox selector such as a bin number or a bin name, or (2)
   as a set of "slots" into which multiple copies are collated.
   Sometimes both modes of using the output sub-units can be used on the
   same printer.  All that is important from the viewpoint of the model
   is that the output units can be separately selected.

2.2.5.  Finishers

   A finisher is a sub-unit that performs some operations on the media
   other than marking.  The Finisher Group in the model represents the
   finisher sub-units.  Some examples of finishing processes are
   stapling, punching, binding, inserting, or folding.  Finishing
   processes may have supplies associated with the process.  Stapling,
   binding, and punching are examples of processes that have supplies.
   A printer may have more than one finishing sub-unit and each
   finishing sub-unit may be associated with one or more output sub-
   units. Finishers are described in the companion Finisher MIB
   [RFC3806].

   The model does not specify the exact interaction and sequencing
   between an output device and its associated finisher.  It depends on
   the type of finishing process and the exact implementation of the
   printer system.  This standard allows for the logical association of
   a finishing process with an output device but does not put any
   restrictions on the exact sequence or interaction with the associated
   output device.  The output and finisher sub-units may or may not be
   separate identifiable physical mechanisms depending on the exact




Bergman, et al.             Standards Track                    [Page 12]

RFC 3805                     Printer MIB v2                    June 2004


   implementation of a printer.  In addition, a single output device may
   be associated with multiple finishing sub-units and a single
   finishing sub-unit may be associated with multiple output devices.

2.2.6.  Markers

   A marker is the mechanism that produces marks on the print media.
   The Marker Group in the model represents the marker sub-units and
   their associated supplies.  A printer can contain one or more marking
   mechanisms.  Some examples of multiple marker sub-units are a printer
   with separate markers for normal and magnetic ink or an image setter
   that can output to both a proofing device and final film.  Each
   marking device can have its own set of characteristics associated
   with it, such as marking technology and resolution.

   In this model the marker sub-unit is viewed as very generalized and
   encompasses all aspects of a marking process.  For example, in a
   xerographic process, the marking process as well as the fusing
   process would be included in the generalized concept of the marker.
   With the generalized concept of a marking process, the concept of
   multiple marking supplies associated with a single marking sub-unit
   results.  For example, in the xerographic process, there is not only
   a supply of toner, but there can also be other supplies such as a
   fuser supply (e.g., fuser oil) that can be consumed and replaced
   separately.  In addition there can be multiple supplies of toner for
   a single marker device, as in a color process.

2.2.7.  Media Paths

   The media paths encompass the mechanisms in the printer that move the
   media through the printer and connect all other media related sub-
   units: inputs, outputs, markers and finishers.  A printer contains
   one or more media paths.  The Media Path Group in the model
   represents these.  The Media Path group has some objects that apply
   to all paths plus a table of the separate media paths.

   In general, the design of the media paths determines the maximum
   speed of the printer as well as the maximum media size that the
   printer can handle.  Media paths are complex mechanisms and can
   contain many different identifiable sub-mechanisms such as media
   movement devices, media buffers, duplex units and interlocks.  Not
   all of the various sub-mechanisms reside on every media path.  For
   example, one media path may provide printing only on one surface of
   the media (a simplex path) and another media path may have a sub-
   mechanism that turns the media over and feeds it a second time
   through the marker sub-unit (a duplex path).  The duplex path may





Bergman, et al.             Standards Track                    [Page 13]

RFC 3805                     Printer MIB v2                    June 2004


   even have a buffer sub-mechanism that allows multiple copies of the
   obverse side to be held before the reverse side of all the copies is
   marked.

2.2.8.  System Controller

   The System Controller is the sub-unit upon which the software
   components of the Printer run.  The Host Resources MIB [RFC2790]
   represents the System Controller in the model.  The Host Resources
   MIB allows for the specification of the processor(s), memory, disk
   storage, file system and other underlying sub-mechanisms of the
   printer.  The controller can range from simple single processor
   systems to multiprocessor systems.  In addition, controllers can have
   a full range of resources such as hard disks.  The printer is modeled
   to have one system controller even though it may have more than one
   processor and multiple other resources associated with it.

2.2.9.  Interfaces

   An interface is the communications port and associated protocols that
   are responsible for the transport of data to the printer.  A printer
   has one or more interface sub-units.  The interfaces are represented
   by the Interfaces Group of MIB-II [RFC1213], [RFC2863].  Some
   examples of interfaces are serial ports (with little or no protocol)
   and Ethernet ports on which one might run Internet IP, Novell IPX,
   etc.

2.2.10.  Print Job Delivery Channels

   The print job delivery channel sub-units identify the independent
   sources of print data (here print data is the information that is
   used to construct printed pages and may have both data and control
   aspects).  A printer may have one or more channels.  The channel sub-
   units are represented by the Print Job Delivery Channel Group in the
   Model.  The electronic path typically identifies each channel and
   service protocol used to deliver print data to the printer.  A
   channel sub-unit may be independently enabled (allowing print data to
   flow) or disabled (stopping the flow of print data).  It has a
   current Control Language that can be used to specify which
   interpreter is to be used for the print data and to query and change
   environment variables used by the interpreters (and SNMP).  There is
   also a default interpreter that is to be used if an interpreter is
   not explicitly specified using the Control Language.  Print Job
   Delivery Channel sub-units can, and usually are, based on an
   underlying interface.

RFC 3805                     Printer MIB v2                    June 2004


2.2.11.  Interpreters

   The interpreter sub-units are responsible for the conversion of a
   description of intended print instances into images that are to be
   marked on the media.  A printer may have one or more interpreters.
   The Interpreter Group in the Model represents the interpreter sub-
   units. Each interpreter is generally implemented with software
   running on the System Controller sub-unit.  The Interpreter Table has
   one entry per interpreter where the interpreters include both Page
   Description Language (PDL) Interpreters and Control Language
   Interpreters.

2.2.12.  Console

   Many printers have a console on the printer, the operator console
   that is used to display and modify the state of the printer.  The
   console can be as simple as a few indicators and switches or as
   complicated as full screen displays and keyboards.  There can be at
   most one such console.  The Console Group in the model represents
   this console sub-unit.  Although most of the information displayed
   there is also available in the state of the printer as represented by
   the various Groups, it is useful to be able to query and modify the
   operator console remotely.  For example, a management application
   might like to display to its user the current message on the operator
   console of the remote printer or the management application user
   might like to modify the current message on the operators console of
   the remote printer.  As another example, one might have a remote
   application that puts up a pseudo console on a workstation screen.
   Since the rules by which the printer state is mapped onto the console
   and vice versa are not standardized, it is not possible to reproduce
   the console state or the action of console buttons and menus.
   Therefore, the Console Group provides access to the console.  The
   operator console is usually implemented on the system controller with
   additional hardware for input and display.

2.2.13.  Alerts

   The alert sub-unit is responsible for detecting reportable events,
   making an entry in the alert table and, if and only if the event is a
   critical event, initiating a trap.  The exception to this rule is
   when the "alertRemovalofBinaryChangeEntry" trap is generated.  The
   alert sub-unit is represented by the Alerts Group and, in particular,
   the Alert Table.  This table contains information on the severity,
   sub- unit, and detailed location within the sub-unit, alert code and
   description of each alert that is currently active within the
   printer.  Each reportable event causes an entry to be made in the
   Alert Table.

RFC 3805                     Printer MIB v2                    June 2004


2.2.13.1.  Status and Alerts

   Summary information about the state of the printer is reported at
   three separate levels: (1) The status of the printer as a whole is
   reported in the Host Resources MIB, (2) The status of various sub-
   units is reported in the principle table of the Group that represents
   the sub-unit, and (3) Alert codes are reported in the Alert Table.

2.2.13.2.  Overall Printer Status

   Of the many states a printer can be in, certain states are more
   "interesting" because of the distinct actions they are likely to
   provoke in the administrator.  These states may be applied to the
   printer as a whole, or to a particular sub-unit of the printer.
   These named states are:

   Non Critical Alert Active - For the printer this means that one or
   more sub-units have a non-critical alert active.  For a sub-unit,
   this means that the sub-unit has a non-critical alert active.

   Critical Alert Active - For the printer this means that one or more
   sub-units have a critical alert active.  For a sub-unit, this means
   that the sub-unit has a critical alert active.

   Unavailable - The printer or sub-unit is unavailable for use (this is
   the same as "broken" or "down" in other terminology).  A trained
   service person is typically necessary to make it available.

   Moving on-line or off-line - The printer is either off-line, in the
   process of moving off-line or moving back on-line.  For example, on
   printers with motorized hoppers, reloading paper involves a
   transition to off-line to open the paper bin, filling the hopper and,
   finally, a transition back to on-line as the paper bin is
   repositioned for printing.

   Standby - The printer or sub-unit is not immediately available but
   can accept new instructions.

   Available - The printer or subunit is functioning normally.

   Idle - The printer or subunit is immediately available.

   Active - The printer or subunit is performing its primary function.

   Busy - The printer or subunit is performing a function (not
   necessarily its primary function) and is not immediately available
   for its primary function.

   The Host Resources MIB [RFC2790] provides three status objects that
   can be used to describe the status of a printer: (1) hrDeviceStatus
   in the entry in the hrDeviceTable; (2) hrPrinterStatus in the
   hrPrinterTable; and (3) hrPrinterDetectedErrorState in the
   hrPrinterTable.  These objects describe many of the states that a
   printer can be in.  The following table shows how the values of the
   three printer-related objects in the Host Resources MIB relate to the
   states named above:

   Printer       hrDeviceStatus hrPrinterStatus hrPrinterDetected-
   Status                                       ErrorState

   Alert Active                  printing(4)    lowToner, or
                                                serviceRequested

   Critical       down(5)        other(1)       could be: jammed,
   Alert Active                                 noPaper, noToner,
                                                coverOpen, or
                                                serviceRequested

   Unavailable    down(5)        other(1)

   Moving off-    warning(3)     idle(3) or     offline
   line                          printing(4)

   Moving         down(5)        warmup(5)
   on-line

   Standby        running(2)     other(1)

   These named states are only a subset of the possible states - they
   are not an exhaustive list of the possible states.  Nevertheless,
   several things should be noted.  When using these states, it is not
   possible to detect when both critical and non-critical alerts are
   pending - if both are pending, the Critical Alert Active state will
   prevail.  In addition, a printer in the Standby state will be
   represented in the Host Resources MIB with a device status of
   running(2) and a printer status of other(1), a set of states that
   don't uniquely distinguish this important printer state.

2.2.13.2.2.  Sub-unit Status

   Sub-unit status is reported in the entries of the principle table in
   the Group that represents the sub-unit.  For sub-units that report a
   status, there is a status column in the table and the value of this
   column is always an integer formed in the following way.

   The PrtSubUnitStatusTC is an integer that is the sum of 5 distinct
   values, Availability, Non-Critical, Critical, On-line, and
   Transitioning.  These values are:

   Availability                           value

           Available and Idle               0       000'b

   For example, an input (tray) that jammed on the next to the last page
   may show a status of 27 (unavailable because broken (3) + a critical
   state (16), jammed, and a noncritical state (8), low paper).

2.2.13.3.  Alert Tables

   The Alert Group consists of a single table in which all active alerts
   are represented.  This section provides an overview of the table and
   a description of how it is managed.  The basic content of the alert
   table is the severity (critical or non-critical) of the alert, the
   Group and entry where a state change caused the alert, additional
   information about the alert (a more detailed location, an alert code,
   and a description), and an indication of the level of training needed
   to service the alert.

   The Alert Table contains some information that is redundant, for
   example that an event has occurred, and some information that is only
   represented in the Alert Table, for example the additional
   information.  A single table was used because a single entry in a
   group could cause more than one alert, for example paper jams in more
   than one place in a media path.  Associating the additional
   information with the entry in the affected group would only allow one
   report where associating the additional information with the alert
   makes multiple reports possible.  Every time an alert occurs in the
   printer, the printer makes one or more entries into the Alert Table.
   The printer determines if an event is to be classified as critical or
   non-critical.  If the severity of the Alert is "critical", the
   printer sends a trap or event notification to the host indicating
   that the table has changed.  Whether or not a trap is sent, the
   management application is expected to poll the printer on a regular
   basis and to read and parse the table to determine what conditions
   have changed, in order to provide reliable information to the
   management application user.

2.2.13.4.  Alert Table Management

   The alert tables are sparsely populated tables.  This means the
   tables will only contain entries of the alerts that are currently
   active and the number of rows, or entries in the table will be
   dynamic.  More than one event can be added or removed from the event
   tables at a time depending on the implementation of the printer.

   There are basically two kinds of events that produce alerts: binary
   change events and unary change events.  Binary change events come in
   pairs: the leading edge event and the trailing edge event.  The
   leading edge event enters a state from which there is only one exit;
   for example, going from running to stopped with a paper jam.  The
   only exit from this state is fixing the paper jam and it is clear



Bergman, et al.             Standards Track                    [Page 21]

RFC 3805                     Printer MIB v2                    June 2004


   when that is accomplished.  The trailing edge event exits the state
   that was entered by the leading edge event.  In the example above,
   fixing the paper jam is the trailing edge event.

   It is relatively straightforward to manage binary change events in
   the Alert Table.  Only the leading edge event makes an entry in the
   alert table.  This entry persists in the Alert Table until the
   trailing edge event occurs at which point this event is signaled by
   the removal of the leading edge event entry in the Alert Table.  That
   is, a trailing edge event does not create an entry; it removes the
   corresponding leading edge event.  Removing the leading edge entry
   may cause the unary change event "alertRemovalofBinaryChangeEntry" to
   be added to the table.  With binary change events it is possible to
   compute the maximum number that can occur at the same time and
   construct an Alert Table that would hold that many events.  There
   would be no possibility of table overflow and no information about
   outstanding events would be lost.

   Unfortunately, there are some events that are not binary changes.
   This other category of event, the unary change event, is illustrated
   by the configuration change event.  With this kind of event the state
   of the machine has changed, but to a state which is (often) just as
   valid as the state that was left and from which no return is
   necessary.  For example, an operator may change the paper that is in
   the primary input source from letter to legal.  At some time in the
   future the paper may be changed back to letter, but it might be
   changed to executive instead.  This is where the problem occurs.  It
   is not obvious how long to keep unary change event entries in the
   Alert Table.  If they were never removed, the Alert Table would
   continue to grow indefinitely.

   The agent needs to have an algorithm implemented for the management
   of the alert table, especially in the face of combinations of binary
   and unary alerts that would overflow the storage capacity of the
   table.  When the table is full and new alerts need to be added, an
   old alert to be deleted should be chosen using the following rules:

   1. Find a non-critical unary alert and delete it.  If there are
      multiple non-critical unary alerts, it is suggested that the
      oldest one is chosen.  If there are no non-critical unary alerts,
      then,

   2. Find a non-critical binary alert and delete it.  If there are
      multiple non-critical binary alerts, it is suggested that the
      oldest one is chosen.  If there are no non-critical binary alerts,
      then,





Bergman, et al.             Standards Track                    [Page 22]

RFC 3805                     Printer MIB v2                    June 2004


   3. Find a critical (binary) alert and delete it.  If there are
      multiple critical alerts, it is suggested that the oldest one be
      chosen.  Agent implementers are encouraged to provide at least
      enough storage space for the maximum number of critical alerts
      that could occur simultaneously.  Note that all critical alerts
      are binary.

   In the event that a critical binary alert has been deleted out of the
   alert table; when space allows and the alert condition still exists,
   the alert should be re-added to the alert table even if there was no
   subsequent transition into the associated state.  It is recommended
   that this be done for non-critical binary alerts as well.  Note that
   the new alert entry will not have the same index as the original
   entry that was moved out of the table.

   Note that because the Alert Index is a monotonically increasing
   integer there will be gaps in the values in the table when an alert
   is deleted.  The management application may want to re-acquire the
   Printer state and check for state changes that it did not observe in
   the Alert Table if such gaps are detected.

2.3.  Read-Write Objects

   Some objects in the printer MIB reflect the existence or amount of a
   given resource within the printer.  Some examples of such resources
   are the size and number of sheets in a paper tray or the existence of
   certain output options.  Some printers have automatic sensors for
   these resources.  Most printers lack sensors for every property of
   every resource.  The management application is allowed to write into
   objects that hold descriptive or existence values for printers that
   cannot sense these values.  The ability to change the value of a
   read- write object may depend on the implementation of the agent.
   Many objects in the MIB are given read-write access, but a printer
   implementation might only permit a management application to change
   the value if the printer can not sense the value itself.  Note that
   even though some objects explicitly state the behavior of conditional
   ability to change values, any read-write object may act this way.

   Generally, an object is given read-write access in the Printer MIB
   specification if:

   1. The object involves installation of a resource that some printers
      cannot themselves detect.  Therefore, external means are needed to
      inform the printer of the installation.  (Here external means
      include using the operator console, or remote management
      application) and





Bergman, et al.             Standards Track                    [Page 23]

RFC 3805                     Printer MIB v2                    June 2004


   2. The printer will behave differently if the installation of the
      resource is reported than the printer would if the installation
      were not reported; that is, the object is not to be used as a
      place to put information not used by the printer, i.e., not a
      "sticky-note". Another way of saying this is that the printer
      believes that information given it and acts as if the information
      were true.  For example, on a printer that cannot sense the size,
      if one paper size is loaded, but another size is set into the
      paper size object, then the printer will use the size that was set
      as its current paper size in its imaging and paper handling.

   3. The printer may get hints that it may not know about the existence
      or properties of certain resources.  For example, a paper tray may
      be removed and re-inserted.  When this removal and insertion
      happens, the printer may either assume that a property, such as
      the size of paper in the tray, has not changed or the printer may
      change the value of the associated object to "unknown", as might
      be done for the amount of paper in the tray.  As long as the
      printer acts according to the value in  the object either strategy
      is acceptable.

   4. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether or not MIB
      object values are persistent across power cycles or cold starts.
      It is particularly important that the values of the
      prtMarkerLifeCount object persist throughout the lifetime of the
      printer.  Therefore, if the value of any MIB object persists
      across power cycles, then the prtMarkerLifeCount object must also
      persist.

2.4.  Enumerations

   Enumerations (enums) are sets of symbolic values defined for use with
   one or more objects.  Commonly used enumeration sets are assigned a
   symbolic data type name (textual convention), rather than being
   specified in the SYNTAX clause of each individual object definition.

   Textual conventions defined in the Printer MIB or the companion IANA
   Printer MIB are extensible by RFC publication or by Designated Expert
   Review (see the 'IANA Considerations' section of this Printer MIB and
   the DESCRIPTION clause in MODULE-IDENTITY of IANA Printer MIB).  All
   of these textual conventions are:

   a) used more than once in the Printer MIB itself; or

   b) imported and used in the companion Finisher MIB; or

   c) imported and used in any other, including vendor private, MIB
      modules.



Bergman, et al.             Standards Track                    [Page 24]

RFC 3805                     Printer MIB v2                    June 2004


   The Printer MIB has also defined the following special values for use
   with objects of the syntax "Integer32" to define conditions that are
   outside of the normal numeric range:  other(-1), unknown(-2), and
   partial(-3).  The 'partial' value means that there is some supply
   remaining (but the amount is indeterminate) or there is some capacity
   remaining (but the amount is indeterminate).  The Integer32 range
   field indicates in which objects these special values are valid.

2.4.1.  Registering Additional Enumerated Values

   The Printer MIB and the companion IANA Printer MIB each defines one
   category of textual convention, according to the process employed to
   control the addition of new enumerations:

   Type 1 - All of the legal values are defined in the Printer MIB.
   Additional enumerated values require the publication of a new Printer
   MIB.

   Type 2 - All of the legal values are registered in the IANA Printer
   MIB.  Additional enumerated values require a Designated Expert Review
   defined in "Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in
   RFCs" [RFC2434].  The Designated Expert will be selected by the IETF
   Area Director(s) of the Applications Area.

3.  Groups from other MIB Specifications

   This section identifies the groups from other MIBs that shall be
   supported to supplement and complete a printer MIB implementation.
   The section also describes some of the less obvious characteristics
   of the Printer MIB structure that are related to the inclusion of
   these other MIB groups.

3.1.  System Group

   All objects in the system group of MIB-II [RFC1213] shall be
   implemented; however, as described in paragraph 2.4, implementers
   should carefully consider what constitutes the "system".

3.2.  System Controller

   The storage and device groups of the Host Resources MIB [RFC2790]
   shall be implemented to support the printer(s) system controller, and
   any supporting devices.  If deemed appropriate by the implementer,
   other groups of the Host Resources MIB (System, Running Software,
   Running Software Performance, and Installed Software) may be
   implemented.  Because of the structure of the Host Resources MIB, the
   devices constituting the system controller are at the same level as
   the printer.

RFC 3805                     Printer MIB v2                    June 2004


3.3.  Interface Group objects

   All objects in the Interfaces Group of MIB-II [RFC1213] shall be
   implemented for all print information interfaces to the printer,
   including non-network interfaces.

3.3.1.  Interface Types

   The interfaces group of RFC 1213 [RFC1213] contains only a partial
   list of interface types that can be specified in the "ifType" object.
   For a complete list of interface types, refer to the IANA registry at
   "ftp://ftp.isi.edu/mib/iana.mib/ianaiftype.mib"

4.  Differences from RFC 1759

   This document supersedes and replaces RFC 1759.  However, a compliant
   implementation of RFC 1759 is also compliant with this document.  The
   following changes to RFC 1759 are included:  (See the printmib
   REVISION/DESCRIPTION clause for additional details of changes.)

   -  Minor editorial corrections and changes.  Updated the cover page
      and added the "SNMP Management Framework" boilerplate to section
      1.

   -  Updated figure 2 to use MIB names instead of RFC numbers.

   -  Updated Coded Character Set description and IANA registration
      process.

   -  Change hrPrinterDetectedErrorState "coverOpen" (bit 4) to
      "doorOpen" per RFC 2790.

   -  Added second octet of hrPrinterDetectedErrorState as partially
      described and assigned in the updated Host Resources MIB (RFC
      2790).

   -  Remove fixed association of hrDeviceStatus (warning/down) from
      hrPrinterDetetctedErrorState per RFC 2790.

   -  Instead of showing bit 15 as "not assigned" in the quote from RFC
      2790 in the hrPrinterDetectedErrorState object, removed that from
      the tabular form and added it as a sentence, because the RFC
      doesn't show bit 15 in the tabular form.

   -  Clarified the international considerations.

RFC 3805                     Printer MIB v2                    June 2004


   -  Added prtChannelInformation to the Channel Group textual-
      conventions on a per channel basis to clarify the channel
      description and enhance interoperability.

   -  Deprecated some obsolete channel types.

   -  Extended the Alert Table and PrtMarkerSuppliesSupplyUnit textual
      conventions to include values from the Finisher MIB.

   -  Clarified alerts based on unary vs. binary change events.

   -  Added (optional) unary change event
      alertRemovalOfBinaryChangeEntry(1801).

   -  Establish a convention for contact information for
      prtGeneralCurrentOperator and prtGeneralServicePerson.

   -  Added prtAuxiliarySheetStartupPage     PresentOnOff

   -  Added prtAuxiliarySheetBannerPage      PresentOnOff

   -  Added prtGeneralPrinterName            OCTET STRING

   -  Added prtGeneralSerialNumber           OCTET STRING

   -  Added prtInputNextIndex                Integer32

   -  Added the Input Switching Group

   -  Added prtAlertCriticalEvents           Counter32

   -  Added prtAlertAllEvents                Counter32

   -  Updated PrtAlertCode enums including generic alert codes.

   -  Created five OBJECT-GROUPs (prtAuxilliarySheetGroup,
      prtInputSwitchingGroup, prtGeneralV2Group, prtAlertTableV2Group,
      prtChannelV2Group).  Added the nine new objects to them
      (prtAuxiliarySheetStartupPage, prtAuxiliarySheetBannerPage,
      prtGeneralPrinterName, prtGeneralSerialNumber,
      prtAlertCriticalEvents, prtAlertAllEvents,
      prtInputMediaLoadTimeout, prtInputNextIndex,
      prtChannelInformation).  Created one new NOTIFICATION-GROUP
      (prtAlertTrapGroup) to contain printerV2Alert.  Included the new
      OBJECT-GROUPs and the NOTIFICATION_GROUP in prtMIBCompliance, all
      in GROUP (not MANDATORY-GROUP) clauses.  The nine new objects are
      optional, i.e., this document is backward compatible with RFC
      1759.

   -  prtAlertTime is strongly recommended.

   -  Deprecated the use of alert codes doorOpen(501) and
      doorClosed(502), in favor of coverOpened(3) and coverClosed(4).

   -  Added the PrtConsoleDisableTC and PrtMarkerAddressabilityUnitTC
      textual conventions, and changed the PrtConsoleDisable and
      PrtMarkerAddressabilityUnit objects' syntax to use those TCs, and
      changed the PrtGeneralEntry and PrtMarkerColorantEntry SEQUENCEs
      to reflect the new syntax.

   -  Added textual conventions "PrtLocalizedDescriptionStringTC" and
      "PrtConsoleDescriptionStringTC" and updated several objects to use
      them.

   -  Changed most enumerations to textual conventions and therefore
      changed the SYNTAX of many objects from RFC 1759 to specify the
      appropriate textual conventions.  (28 TCs were added.)

   -  Changed the TC names "MediaUnit" to "PrtMediaUnitTC",
      "CapacityUnit" to "PrtCapacityUnitTC", and "SubUnitStatus" to
      "PrtSubUnitStatusTC"

   -  All objects with a MAX-ACCESS of read-write now have a MIN-ACCESS
      of read-only.

   -  Added 'IANA Considerations' and 'Internationalization
      Considerations' as top level sections, per IETF guidelines.

   -  Updated Security and Copyright sections.

   -  Updated references and split into Normative and Informative
      groups.

   -  Added Appendix E - Overall Printer Status Table.

   -  Updated participant and contact information.

   -  Removed CodedCharSet Textual Convention, replaced with an import
      of the IANACharset.

   -  Removed all comment statements that indicated objects or groups
      are mandatory or optional.  Avoids any potential conflicts with
      the conformance section.

   -  Added text to empty description clauses.  (prtStorageRefTable,
      prtDeviceRefTable, prtMarkerTable, prtMediaPathTable,
      prtChannelTable, prtInterpreterTable, prtConsoleLightTable, and
      prtAlertTable)

   -  Added "DEFVAL { unknown }" to prtInterpreterDefaultCharSetIn and
      prtInterpreterDefaultCharSetOut.

   -  Changed "...values are expected to remain stable..." to "...values
      SHOULD remain stable..." in the description clauses for the index
      object in all tables.

   -  Added ranges to all objects with a syntax of Integer32.

   -  Revised the description clause for prtAlertGroupIndex.

   -  Added additional text to the description clause for
      prtMediaPathEntry, prtChannelEntry, prtInterpreterEntry, and
      printerV2Alert.

   -  Added text to section 2.4 to explain the usage of textual
      conventions in this MIB and others.  Also added a note defining
      the common usage of the enumerations 'other(-1)' and 'unknown(-2)'

   -  Changed range of prtStorageRefSeqNumber, prtDeviceRefSeqNumber,
      and prtConsoleLightIndex from (0..65535) to (1..65535) since index
      values cannot be zero.  (Typo in RFC 1759)

   -  The PWG Standard for Standardized Media Names is now recommended
      for the objects prtInputMediaName, prtInputMediaColor, and
      prtInputMediaType.

   -  Added chSMTP(45) to prtChannelTypeTC.

    DESCRIPTION
        "The level of training required to handle this alert, if
        human intervention is required.  The noInterventionRequired
        value should be used if the event does not require any human
        intervention.  The training level is an enumeration that is
        determined and assigned by the printer manufacturer based on
        the information or training required to handle this alert.
        The printer will break alerts into these different training
        levels.  It is the responsibility of a management application
        in the system to determine how a particular alert is handled
        and how and to whom that alert is routed.  The following are
        the four training levels of alerts:

        Field Service - Alerts that typically require advanced
            training and technical knowledge of the printer and its
            subunits.  An example of a technical person would be a
            manufacturer's Field Service representative, or other
            person formally trained by the manufacturer or similar
            representative.
        Trained - Alerts that require an intermediate or moderate
            knowledge of the printer and its subunits.  A typical
            example of such an alert is replacing a toner cartridge.
        Untrained -     Alerts that can be fixed without prior
            training either because the action to correct the alert
            is obvious or the printer can help the untrained person
            fix the problem.  A typical example of such an alert is
            reloading paper trays or emptying output bins on a low
            end printer.
        Management -    Alerts that have to do with overall operation
            of and configuration of the printer.  Examples of such
            management events are configuration change of subunits."

        the table.  Binary change event alerts describe states of the
        subunit while unary change event alerts describe a single
        event.  The same alert code can be used for a binary change
        event or a unary change event, depending on implementation.
        Also, the same alert code can be used to indicate a critical
        or non-critical (warning) alert, depending on implementation.
        The value of prtAlertSeverityLevel specifies binary vs. unary
        and critical vs. non-critical for each event for the
        implementation.

        While there are some specific codes for many subunits, the
        generic codes should be used for most subunit alerts.  The
        network management station can then query the subunit
        specified by prtAlertGroup to determine further subunit
        status and other subunit information.

        An agent shall not add two entries to the alert table for the
        same event, one containing a generic event code and the other
        containing a specific event code; the agent shall add only
        one entry in the alert table for each event; either generic
        (preferred) or specific, not both.

        Implementation of the unary change event
        alertRemovalOfBinaryChangeEntry(1801) is optional.  When
        implemented, this alert code shall indicate to network
        management stations that the trailing edge of a binary change
        event has occurred and the corresponding alert entry has been
        removed from the alert table.  As with all events, the
        alertRemovalOfBinaryChangeEntry(1801) alert shall be placed
        at the end of the alert table.  Such an alert table entry
        shall specify the following information:

        prtAlertSeverityLevel   warningUnaryChangeEvent(4)
        prtAlertTrainingLevel   noInterventionRequired(7)
        prtAlertGroup           alert(18)
        prtAlertGroupIndex      the index of the row in the
                                alert table of the binary
                                change event that this event
                                has removed.

                                binary change event from the
                                alert table.

        event alertRemovalOfBinaryChangeEntry(1801) in the alert

    REVISION     "200406020000Z"
    DESCRIPTION
        "Printer MIB v2.
        Moved all enum groups to be maintained by IANA into new TCs
           within the ianaPrinterMIB, which is contained in this
           document.
        New TCs created from enums defined within RFC 1759 Objects:
           PrtPrintOrientationTC, PrtLocalizedDescriptionStringTC,
           PrtConsoleDescriptionStringTC, PrtChannelStateTC,
           PrtOutputStackingOrderTC, PrtOutputPageDeliveryOrientationTC,
           PrtMarkerCounterUnitTC, PrtMarkerSuppliesSupplyUnitTC,
           PrtMarkerSuppliesClassTC, PrtMarkerAddressabilityUnitTC,
           PrtMarkerColorantRoleTC, PrtMediaPathMaxSpeedPrintUnitTC,
           PrtInterpreterTwoWayTC, and PrtAlertSeverityLevelTC.
        The following four TCs have been deprecated:
           MediaUnit (replaced by PrtMediaUnitTC),
           CapacityUnit (replaced by PrtCapacityUnitTC),
           SubUnitStatus (replaced by PrtSubUnitStatusTC),
           CodedCharSet (replaced by IANACharset in IANA Charset MIB)
        Five new OBJECT-GROUPs: prtAuxilliarySheetGroup,
           prtInputSwitchingGroup, prtGeneralV2Group,
           prtAlertTableV2Group, prtChannelV2Group.
        Nine new objects added to those groups:
           prtAuxiliarySheetStartupPage, prtAuxiliarySheetBannerPage,
           prtGeneralPrinterName, prtGeneralSerialNumber,
           prtAlertCriticalEvents, prtAlertAllEvents,

           prtInputMediaLoadTimeout, prtInputNextIndex,
           prtChannelInformation.
        SYNTAX range changed from (0..65535) to (1..65535) for the
           index objects prtStorageRefSeqNumber, prtDeviceRefSeqNumber,
           and prtConsoleLightIndex.
        SYNTAX range changed from (0..65535) to (0..2147483647) for the
           objects prtStorageRefIndex and prtDeviceRefIndex to agree
           with the Host Resources MIB.
        Defined a range for the objects with a SYNTAX of Integer32:
           prtOutputDefaultIndex, prtInputMediaDimFeedDirDeclared,
           prtInputMediaDimXFeedDirDeclared, prtInputMaxCapacity,
           prtInputCurrentLevel, prtInputMediaDimFeedDirChosen,
           prtInputMediaDimXFeedDirChosen, prtInputMediaWeight,
           prtInputMediaFormParts, prtOutputIndex,
           prtOutputMaxCapacity, prtOutputRemainingCapacity,
           prtOutputMaxDimFeedDir, prtOutputMaxDimXFeedDir,
           prtOutputMinDimFeedDir, prtOutputMinDimXFeedDir,
           prtMarkerAddressibilityFeedDir,
           prtMarkerAddressibilityXFeedDir, prtMarkerNorthMargin,
           prtMarkerSouthMargin, prtMarkerWestMargin,
           prtMarkerEastMargin, prtMarkerSuppliesMaxCapacity,
           prtMarkerSuppliesLevel, prtMarkerColorantTonality,
           prtMediaPathMaxSpeed, prtMediaPathMaxMediaFeedDir,
           prtMediaPathMaxMediaXFeedDir, prtMediaPathMinMediaFeedDir,
           prtMediaPathMinMediaXFeedDir, prtChannelIndex,
           prtChannelCurrentJobCntlLangIndex, prtInterpreterIndex,
           prtChannelDefaultPageDescLangIndex, prtConsoleOnTime,
           prtInterpreterFeedAddressibility, prtConsoleOffTime,
           prtInterpreterXFeedAddressibility, prtAlertIndex,
           prtAlertGroupIndex, prtAlertLocation.
        Changed SYNTAX from Integer32 to InterfaceIndexOrZero for
           prtChannelIfIndex.
        Changed MAX-ACCESS of prtAlertIndex from not-accessible to
           Read-only and added a compliance statement to allow a
           MIN-ACCESS of accessible-for-notify.
        One new NOTIFICATION-GROUP: prtAlertTrapGroup which contains
           printerV2Alert.
        In MODULE-COMPLIANCE prtMIBCompliance, new OBJECT-GROUPs and
           the NOTIFICATION_GROUP, all in GROUP (not MANDATORY-GROUP)
           clauses.  The nine new objects are optional, i.e., this
           document is backward compatible with RFC 1759."

        the cross feed direction) is present in this input source.  Note
        that this value will be used even if the input tray is empty.
        The cross feed direction is ninety degrees relative to the feed
        direction associated with this sub-unit.  This dimension is
        measured in input sub-unit dimensional units (controlled by
        prtInputDimUnit, which uses PrtMediaUnitTC).  If the printer
        supports the declare dimension, the granted dimension is the
        same as the declared dimension.  If not, the granted dimension
        is set to the closest dimension that the printer supports when
        the declared dimension is set.  The value (-1) means other and
        specifically indicates that this sub-unit places no restriction

-- The Marker Group
--
-- A marker is the mechanism that produces marks on the print
-- media.  The marker sub-units and their associated supplies are
-- represented by the Marker Group in the model.  A printer can
-- contain one or more marking mechanisms.  Some examples of
-- multiple marker sub-units are: a printer
-- with separate markers for normal and magnetic ink or an
-- imagesetter that can output to both a proofing device and
-- final film.  Each marking device can have its own set of
-- characteristics associated with it, such as marking technology
-- and resolution.

-- The Print Job Delivery Channel Group
--
-- Print Job Delivery Channels are independent sources of print

-- that is used to construct printed pages and may have both data
-- and control aspects.  The output of a channel is in a form
-- suitable for input to one of the interpreters as a
-- stream.  A channel may be independently enabled (allowing
-- print data to flow) or disabled (stopping the flow of
-- print data).  A printer may have one or more channels.
--
-- The Print Job Delivery Channel table describes the
-- capabilities of the printer and not what is currently being
-- performed by the printer
--
-- Basically, the print job delivery channel abstraction
-- describes the final processing step of getting the print data
-- to an interpreter.  It might include some level of
-- decompression or decoding of print stream data.
-- channel.  All of these aspects are hidden in the channel
-- abstraction.
--
-- There are many kinds of print job delivery channels; some of
-- which are based on networks and others which are not.  For
-- example, a channel can be a serial (or parallel) connection;
-- it can be a service, such as the UNIX Line Printer Daemon
-- (LPD), offering services over a network connection; or
-- it could be a disk drive into which a floppy disk with
-- the print data is inserted.  Each print job delivery channel is
-- identified by the electronic path and/or service protocol
-- used to deliver print data to a print data interpreter.

-- not explicitly specified using the Control Language.

-- The first seven items in the Print Job Delivery Channel Table
-- define the "channel" itself.  A channel typically depends on
-- other protocols and interfaces to provide the data that flows
-- through the channel.
--
-- Control of a print job delivery channel is largely limited to
-- enabling or disabling the entire channel itself.  It is likely
-- that more control of the process of accessing print data
-- will be needed over time.  Thus, the ChannelType will
-- allow type-specific data to be associated with each
-- channel (using ChannelType specific groups in a fashion
-- analogous to the media specific MIBs that are associated
-- with the IANAIfType in the Interfaces Table).  As a first
-- step in this direction, each channel will identify the
-- underlying Interface on which it is based.  This is the
-- eighth object in each row of the table.

    DESCRIPTION
        "Auxiliary information to allow a printing application to use
        the channel for data submission to the printer.  An application
        capable of using a specific PrtChannelType should be able to
        use the combined information from the prtChannelInformation and
        other channel and interface group objects to 'bootstrap' its
        use of the channel.  prtChannelInformation is not intended to
        provide a general channel description, nor to provide
        information that is available once the channel is in use.

        The encoding and interpretation of the prtChannelInformation
        object is specific to channel type.  The description of each
        PrtChannelType enum value for which prtChannelInformation is
        defined specifies the appropriate encoding and interpretation,
        including interaction with other objects.  For channel types
        that do not specify a prtChannelInformation value, its value
        shall be null (0 length).

        When a new PrtChannelType enumeration value is registered, its
        accompanying description must specify the encoding and
        interpretation of the prtChannelInformation value for the
        channel type.  prtChannelInformation semantics for an existing
        PrtChannelType may be added or amended in the same manner as
        described in section 2.4.1 for type 2 enumeration values.

        The prtChannelInformation specifies values for a collection of
        channel attributes, represented as text according to the
        following rules:

        1. The prtChannelInformation is not affected by localization.

        2. The prtChannelInformation is a list of entries representing
        the attribute values.  Each entry consists of the following

RFC 3805                     Printer MIB v2                    June 2004


        items, in order:

        a. A keyword, composed of alphabetic characters (A-Z, a-z)
        represented by their NVT ASCII [RFC854] codes, that
        identifies a channel attribute,

        b. The NVT ASCII code for an Equals Sign (=) (code 61) to
        delimit the keyword,

        c. A data value encoded using rules specific to the
        PrtChannelType to with the prtChannelInformation applies which
        must in no case allow an octet with value 10 (the NVT ASCII
        Line Feed code),

        d. the NVT ASCII code for a Line Feed character (code 10) to
        delimit the data value.

        No other octets shall be present.

        Keywords are case-sensitive.  Conventionally, keywords are
        capitalized (including each word of a multi-word keyword) and
        since they occupy space in the prtChannelInformation, they are
        kept short.

        3. If a channel attribute has multiple values, it is
        represented by multiple entries with the same keyword, each
        specifying one value. Otherwise, there shall be at most one
        entry for each attribute.

        4. By default, entries may appear in any order.  If there are
        ordering constraints for particular entries, these must be
        specified in their definitions.

        5. The prtChannelInformation value by default consists of text
        represented by NVT ASCII graphics character codes.  However,
        other representations may be specified:

        a. In cases where the prtChannelInformation value contains
        information not normally coded in textual form, whatever
        symbolic representation is conventionally used for the
        information should be used for encoding the
        prtChannelInformation value.  (For instance, a binary port value
        might be represented as a decimal number using NVT ASCII
        codes.)  Such encoding must be specified in the definition of
        the value.

        b. The value may contain textual information in a character set
        other than NVT ASCII graphics characters.  (For instance, an

        identifier might consist of ISO 10646 text encoded using the
        UTF-8 encoding scheme.)  Such a character set and its encoding
        must be specified in the definition of the value.

        6. For each PrtChannelType for which prtChannelInformation
        entries are defined, the descriptive text associated with the
        PrtChannelType enumeration value shall specify the following
        information for each entry:

        Title:        Brief description phrase, e.g.: 'Port name',
                      'Service Name', etc.

        Keyword:      The keyword value, e.g.: 'Port' or 'Service'

        Syntax:       The encoding of the entry value if it cannot be
                      directly represented by NVT ASCII.

        Status:       'Mandatory', 'Optional', or 'Conditionally
                      Mandatory'

        Multiplicity: 'Single' or 'Multiple' to indicate whether the
                      entry may be present multiple times.

        Description:  Description of the use of the entry, other
                      information required to complete the definition
                      (e.g.: ordering constraints, interactions between
                      entries).

        Applications that interpret prtChannelInformation should ignore
        unrecognized entries, so they are not affected if new entry
        types are added."

9.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   prtGeneralTable:
      prtGeneralCurrentLocalization  -  Possible data loss
      prtGeneralReset  -  Possible data loss

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

   Where the operational capability of the printing device are
   especially vulnerable or difficult to administer, certain objects
   within this MIB have been tagged as READ-ONLY, preventing
   modification.  Further, for all READ-WRITE objects within the MIB,
   the working group has included specific conformance guidelines



Bergman, et al.             Standards Track                   [Page 149]

RFC 3805                     Printer MIB v2                    June 2004


   stating that vendors are free to implement these objects as READ-
   ONLY.  This conformance allowance should cover cases where specific
   vendor vulnerabilities may differ from product to product.  (See
   conformance section with regards to MIN-ACCESS clauses).

Appendix A - Glossary of Terms

   Addressability - On the marker, the number of distinct marking units
   (pels) per unit of addressability unit that can be set; for example,
   300 dots per inch is expressed as 300 per 1000 Thousandths Of Inches
   and 4 dots per millimeter is 4 per 1000 Micrometers.  Addressability
   is not resolution because marks that are one addressability position
   apart may not be independently resolvable by the eye due to factors
   such as gain in the area of marks so they overlap or nearly touch.

   Alert - A reportable event for which there is an entry in the alert
   table.

   Bin - An output sub-unit which may or may not be removable.

   Binary Change Event - An event which comes in pairs; the leading edge
   event and the trailing edge event.  The leading edge event enters a
   state from which there is only one exit.  A binary change event may
   be critical or non-critical. See unary change event.

   Bursting - The process by which continuous media is separated into
   individual sheets, typically by bursting along pre-formed
   perforations.

   Channel - A term used to describe a single source of data which is
   presented to a printer.  The model that we use in describing a
   printer allows for an arbitrary number of channels.  Multiple
   channels can exist on the same physical port.  This is commonly done
   over Ethernet ports where EtherTalk, TCP/IP, and SPX/IPX protocols
   can be supplying different data streams simultaneously to a single
   printer on the same physical port.

   Collation - In multiple copy output, placing the pages from separate
   copies into separate ordered sets, ready for binding.

   Control Language - A data syntax or language for controlling the
   printer through the print data channel.

   Critical Alert - An alert triggered by an event which leads to a
   state in which printing is no longer possible; the printer is
   stopped.

   Decollating - The process by which the individual parts within a
   multi-part form are separated and sorted into separate stacks for
   each part.

   Description - Information about the configuration and capabilities of
   the printer and its various sub-units.

RFC 3805                     Printer MIB v2                    June 2004


   DPA - ISO 10175 Document Printing Application standard.  A standard
   for a client server protocol for a print system, including (1)
   submitting print jobs to and (2) managing print jobs in a spooler.

   Event - A state change in the printer.

   Group - A collection of objects that represent a type of sub-unit of
   the printer.

   Host Resources MIB - See [RFC2790].

   IANA - Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.  See [RFC3232].

   Idempotent - Idempotence is the property of an operation that results
   in the same state no matter how many times it is executed (at least
   once).  This is a property that is shared by true databases in which
   operations on data items only change the state of the data item and
   do not have other side effects.  Because the SNMP data model is that
   of operations on a database, SNMP MIB objects should be assumed to be
   idempotent.  If a MIB object is defined in a non-idempotent way, the
   this data model can break in subtle ways when faced with packet loss,
   multiple managers, and other common conditions.

      In order to fulfill the common need for actions to result from
      SNMP Set operations, SNMP MIB objects can be modeled such that the
      change in state from one state to another has the side effect of
      causing an action.  It is important to note that with this model,
      an SNMP operation that sets a value equal to its current value
      will cause no action.  This retains the idempotence of a single
      command, while allowing actions to be initiated by SNMP SET
      requests.

   Input - A tray or bin from which instances of the media are obtained
   and fed into the Media Path.

   Interpreter - The embodiment of an algorithm that processes a data
   stream consisting of a Page Description Language (PDL) and/or a
   Control Language.

   Localization - The specification of human language, country, and
   character set needed to present information to people in their native
   languages.

   Management Application (a.k.a. Manager) - A program which queries and
   controls one or more managed nodes.

   Management Station - A physical computer on which one or more
   management applications can run.

RFC 3805                     Printer MIB v2                    June 2004


   Media Path - The mechanisms that transport instances of the media
   from an input, through the marker, possibly through media buffers and
   duplex pathways, out to the output with optional finishing applied.
   The inputs and outputs are not part of the Media Path.

   Non-critical Alert - An alert triggered by a reportable event which
   does not lead to a state in which printing is no longer possible;
   such an alert may lead to a state from which printing may no longer
   be possible in the future, such as the low toner state or the alert
   may be pure informational, such as a configuration change at the
   printer.

   Output - A bin or stacker which accepts instances of media that have
   been processed by a printer.

   Page Description Language (PDL) - A data syntax or language for the
   electronic representation of a document as a sequence of page images.

   Printer - A physical device that takes media from an input source,
   produces marks on that media according to some page description or
   page control language and puts the result in some output destination,
   possibly with finishing applied.

   Printing - The entire process of producing a printed document from
   generation of the file to be printed, choosing printing properties,
   selection of a printer, routing, queuing, resource management,
   scheduling, and finally printing including notifying the user.

   Reportable event - An event that is deemed of interest to a
   management station watching the printer.

   Status - Information regarding the current operating state of the
   printer and its various sub-units.  This is an abstraction of the
   exact physical condition of the printer.

   Sub-mechanism - A distinguishable part of a sub-unit.

   Sub-unit - A part of the printer which may be a physical part, such
   as one of the input sources or a logical part such as an interpreter.

   Tray - An input sub-unit which is typically removable.

   Unary Change Event - An event that indicates a change of state of the
   printer, but to a state which is (often) just as valid as the state
   that was left, and from which no return is necessary.  See binary
   change event.

RFC 3805                     Printer MIB v2                    June 2004


   Visible state - The portion of the state of the printer that can be
   examined by a management application.

   Warning - A non-critical alert.  See non-critical alert.

Appendix B - Media Size Names

   The PWG Standardized Media Names specification [PWGMEDIA], section 5
   Self  Describing Names, contains the currently recommended media size
   names.  This appendix lists the standardized media size names from
   ISO/IEC 10175 Document Printing Application (DPA), [ISO10175] as
   presented in RFC 1759.  Management applications are encouraged to use
   the names from the PWG standard.  However, many legacy systems exist
   that use the DPA names and they are presented here for the
   convenience of developers.

   A printer implementing the Printer MIB has no knowledge of these
   names, however; all media sizes in the MIB are given in terms of
   media dimensions as the values of prtInputMediaDimFeedDirChosen and
   prtInputMediaDimXFeedDirChosen.

Appendix C - Media Names

   For the convenience of management application developers, this
   appendix lists the standardized media names from ISO/IEC 10175
   Document Printing Application (DPA), [ISO10175].  Management
   applications that present a dialogue for choosing media may wish to
   use these names as an alternative to separately specifying, size,
   color, and/or type.  New names may also be created using this format
   and the names defined in the PWG Standardized Media Names
   specification [PWGMEDIA].

   Using standard media names will mean that a single management
   application dealing with printers from different vendors and under
   different system mangers will tend to use the same names for the same
   media.  If selection of media by name is used, the attributes (size,
   type or color) implied by the name must be explicitly mapped to the
   appropriate object (prtInputMediaDimFeedDirDeclared,
   prtInputMediaDimXFeedDirDeclared, prtInputMediaType and
   prtInputMediaColor) in the MIB.  The object prtInputMediaName is
   intended for display to an operator and is purely descriptive.  The
   value in prtInputMediaName is not interpreted by the printer so using
   a standard name for this value will not change any of the other media
   attributes nor will it cause an alert if the media in the input sub-
   unit does not match the name.

Appendix D - Roles of Users

   Background

   The need for "Role Models" stemmed in large part from the need to
   understand the importance of any given proposed object for the MIB.
   Many times the real world need for a proposed object would be debated
   within the group; the debate would typically result in the need to
   describe the potential usage of the object in terms of a "live"
   person performing some type of printing-related task.

   Determining the value of a proposed object through identification of
   the associated human users was found to be so common that a more
   formalized model was required for consistent analysis.  The model
   describing categories of human-oriented tasks is called "Role Models"
   in this document.

   In developing the Role Models it was necessary to identify the
   common, primary tasks that humans typically face when interacting
   with a printer and its related printing system(s).  It was expected
   that certain kinds of tasks would serve to identify the various Role
   Models.

   In presenting the set of Role Models, the set of "Common Print System
   Tasks" are first presented, followed by the set of Role Model
   definitions.  Finally, a simple matrix is presented in which Role
   Models and Tasks are cross-compared.

   Common Print System Tasks

   Upon researching the many tasks encountered by humans in dealing with
   printers and printing systems, the following were found to be
   pervasive within any operating environment:

   Printer job state - Determine the status of a job without a printer.




Bergman, et al.             Standards Track                   [Page 162]

RFC 3805                     Printer MIB v2                    June 2004


   Printer capabilities - Determine the current capabilities of a
   printer, for example, the available media sizes, two-sided printing,
   a particular type of interpreter, etc.

   Printer job submission - Submit a print job to a printer.

   Printer job removal - Remove a job from a printer.

   Notification of events - Receive notification of the existence of a
   defined printer event.  An event can be of many types, including
   warnings, errors, job stage completion (e.g., "job done"), etc.

   Printer configuration - Query the current configuration of a printer.

   Printer consumables - Determine the current state of any and all
   consumables within a printer.

   Print job identification - Determine the identification of a job
   within a printer.

   Internal printer status - Determine the current status of the
   printer.

   Printer identification - Determine the identity of a printer.
   Printer location - Determine the physical location of a printer.

   Local system configuration - Determine various aspects of the current
   configuration of the local system involved with the operation of a
   printer.

   These "tasks" cover a large spectrum of requirements surrounding the
   operation of a printer in a network environment.  This list serves as
   the basis for defining the various Role Models described below.

   Proposed Role Models

   Following is the list of "Role Models" used to evaluate the
   requirements for any given Printer MIB object.  Note that the keyword
   enclosed in parentheses represents an abbreviation for the particular
   Role Model in the matrix described later in this document.

   User  (USER) - A person or application that submits print jobs to the
   printer; typically viewed as the "end user" within the overall
   printing environment.







Bergman, et al.             Standards Track                   [Page 163]

RFC 3805                     Printer MIB v2                    June 2004


   Operator  (OP) - A person responsible for maintaining a printer on a
   day-to-day basis, including such tasks as filling empty media trays,
   emptying full output trays, replacing toner cartridges, clearing
   simple paper jams, etc.

   Technician  (TECH) - A person responsible for repairing a
   malfunctioning printer, performing routine preventive maintenance,
   and other tasks that typically require advanced training on the
   printer internals.  An example of a "technician" would be a
   manufacturer's Field Service representative, or other person formally
   trained by the manufacturer or similar representative.

   System Manager  (MGR) - A person responsible for configuration and
   troubleshooting of components involved in the overall printing
   environment, including printers, print queues and network
   connectivity issues.  This person is typically responsible for
   ensuring the overall operational integrity of the print system
   components, and is typically viewed as the central point of
   coordination among all other Role Models.

   Help Desk  (HELP) - A person responsible for supporting Users in
   their printing needs, including training Users and troubleshooting
   Users' printing problems.

   Asset Manager  (AM) - A person responsible for managing an
   organization's printing system assets (primarily printers).  Such a
   person needs to be able to identify and track the location of
   printing assets on an ongoing basis.

   Capacity Planner  (CP) - A person responsible for tracking the usage
   of printing resources on an ongoing basis for the purpose of planning
   printer acquisitions and/or placement of printers based on usage
   trends.

   Installer  (INST) - A person or application responsible for
   installing or configuring printing system components on a local
   system.

   Accountant  (ACCT) - A person responsible for tracking the usage of
   printing resources on an ongoing basis for the purpose of charging
   Users for resources used.

   Matrix of Common Print System Tasks and Role Models

   To better understand the relationship between the set of defined
   "Common Print System Tasks" and the various "Role Models," the
   following matrix is provided.




Bergman, et al.             Standards Track                   [Page 164]

RFC 3805                     Printer MIB v2                    June 2004


   It is important to recognize that many of the tasks will appear to be
   applicable to many of the Role Models.  However, when considering the
   actual context of a task, it is very important to realize that often
   the actual context of a task is such that the Role Model can change.

   For example, it is obvious that a "System Manager" must be able to
   submit print jobs to a printer; however, when submitting a print job,
   a person identified as a "System Manager" is actually operating in
   the context of a "User" in this case; hence, the requirement to
   submit a print job is not listed as a requirement for a System
   Manager.

   Conversely, while a "User" must be able to remove a job previously
   submitted to a printer, an "Operator" is often expected to be able to
   remove any print job from any printer; hence, print job removal is a
   (subtly different) requirement for both the "User" and "Operator"
   Role Models.

Appendix E - Overall Printer Status Table

   The Status Table establishes a convention for the top 25 printer
   errors.  The table defines a suggested relationship between various
   printer states and the variables Printer hrDeviceStatus,
   hrPrinterStatus, hrPrinterDetectedErrorState, prtAlertGroup,
   prtAlertCode and various sub-unit status variables (prtInputStatus,
   prtOutputStatus, prtMarkerStatus, prtMediaPathStatus and
   prtChannelStatus).  This table is the recommended implementation of
   these variables.  It is provided to guide implementors of this MIB
   and users of the MIB by providing a sample set of states and the
   variable values that are expected to be produced as result of that
   state.  This information supplements that provided in Section



Bergman, et al.             Standards Track                   [Page 165]

RFC 3805                     Printer MIB v2                    June 2004


   2.2.13.2 "Overall Printer Status".  This is not an exhaustive list
   rather it is a guideline.

   The definition of PrtSubUnitStatusTC specifies that SubUnitStatus is
   an integer that is the sum of 5 distinct values/states: Availability,
   Critical, Non-Critical, On-line and Transitioning.  Thus when a non-
   critical alert or alerts are present the values for Availability,
   On-Line and Transitioning will be summed with the Non- Critical
   Alerts (8) value.

   The table was generated in landscape format and is located at
   ftp://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/pmp/contributions/Top25Errors.pdf.
