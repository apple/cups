README - CUPS v1.1 - 07/10/2000
-------------------------------

INTRODUCTION

CUPS provides a portable printing layer for UNIX(r)-based operating
systems.  It has been developed by Easy Software Products to promote a
standard printing solution for all UNIX vendors and users.  CUPS
provides the System V and Berkeley command-line interfaces.

CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol ("IPP") as the basis for
managing print jobs and queues.  The Line Printer Daemon ("LPD") Server
Message Block ("SMB"), and AppSocket (a.k.a. JetDirect) protocols are
also supported with reduced functionality.  CUPS adds network printer
browsing and PostScript Printer Description ("PPD") based printing
options to support real-world printing under UNIX.

CUPS also includes a customized version of GNU Ghostscript (currently
based off GNU Ghostscript 5.50) and an image file RIP that are used to
support non-PostScript printers.  Sample drivers for HP and EPSON
printers are included that use these filters.

Drivers for over 2300 printers are provided with our ESP Print Pro
software, available at:

	http://www.easysw.com/printpro

CUPS is licensed under the GNU General Public License and GNU Library
General Public License.  Please contact Easy Software Products for
commercial support and "binary distribution" rights.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Binary distributions require a minimum of 10MB of free disk space. We
do not recommend using CUPS on a workstation with less than 32MB of RAM
or a PC with less than 16MB of RAM.

If you are installing from source you'll need ANSI-compliant C and C++
compilers and optionally one or more image file support libraries. 
Complete source installation instructions can be found in the CUPS
System Administrator's Manual in the files "doc/sam.html" or
"doc/sam.pdf".


SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

The following operating system software is required to install one of
the binary distributions from Easy Software Products:

    - Digital UNIX (aka OSF1 aka Compaq Tru64 UNIX) 4.0 or higher
    - HP-UX 10.20 or higher
    - IRIX 5.3 or higher
    - Linux 2.0 with glibc2 or higher
    - Solaris 2.5 or higher (SPARC or Intel)


INSTALLING "PORTABLE" CUPS DISTRIBUTIONS

We are currently distributing "portable" CUPS binary distributions in
TAR format with installation and removal scripts generated by our ESP
Package Manager (EPM) software, which is available from:

    http://www.easysw.com/epm

WARNING: Installing CUPS will overwrite your existing printing system.
Backup files are made by the installation script and restored by the
removal script, so if you experience problems you should be able to
remove the CUPS software to restore your previous configuration. 
However, Easy Software Products makes no warranty for this and will not
be liable for any lost revenues, etc.

To install the CUPS software you will need to be logged in as root
(doing an "su" is good enough).  Once you are the root user, run the
installation script with:

    ./cups.install ENTER

After asking you a few yes/no questions the CUPS software will be
installed and the scheduler will be started automatically.


INSTALLING HOST-SPECIFIC (RPM, DEBIAN, ETC.) DISTRIBUTIONS

The host-specific distributions use the operating system software
installation tools.  To install a host-specific distribution please
consult the CUPS Software Administrators Manual or your operating
system documentation.


READING THE DOCUMENTATION

Once you have installed the software you can access the documentation
(and a bunch of other stuff) on-line at:

    http://localhost:631

If you're having trouble getting that far, the documentation is located
in the "/usr/share/doc/cups" directory in the binary distributions, and
under the "doc" directory in the source archives.

Please read the documentation before asking questions.


SETTING UP PRINTER QUEUES USING YOUR WEB BROWSER

CUPS 1.1 includes a new web-based administration tool that allows you
to manage printers, classes, and jobs on your server.  To access the
printer administration tools open the following URL in your browser:

    http://localhost:631/admin

You will be asked for the administration password (root or any other
user in the sys/system/root group on your system) and then shown a
menu of available functions.

DO NOT use the hostname for your machine - it will not work with the
default CUPS configuration.  To enable administration access on other
addresses, consult the CUPS Software Administrators Manual.


SETTING UP PRINTER QUEUES FROM THE COMMAND-LINE

CUPS works best with PPD (PostScript Printer Description) files.  In a
pinch you can also use System V style printer interface scripts.

Six sample PPD files are provided with this distribution that utilize
the PostScript and image file RIPs and the sample EPSON and HP printer
drivers.  To add the sample DeskJet driver to the system for a printer
connected to the parallel port, use one of the following commands:

    Digital UNIX:

        /usr/lib/lpadmin -p DeskJet -m deskjet.ppd -v parallel:/dev/lp0 -E

    HP-UX:

        /usr/lib/lpadmin -p DeskJet -m deskjet.ppd -v parallel:/dev/c2t0d0_lp -E

    IRIX:

        /usr/lib/lpadmin -p DeskJet -m deskjet.ppd -v parallel:/dev/plp -E

    Linux:

        /usr/lib/lpadmin -p DeskJet -m deskjet.ppd -v parallel:/dev/lp0 -E
        /usr/lib/lpadmin -p DeskJet -m deskjet.ppd -v parallel:/dev/lp1 -E
        /usr/lib/lpadmin -p DeskJet -m deskjet.ppd -v parallel:/dev/lp2 -E

    Solaris:

        /usr/lib/lpadmin -p DeskJet -m deskjet.ppd -v parallel:/dev/bpp0 -E
        /usr/lib/lpadmin -p DeskJet -m deskjet.ppd -v parallel:/dev/ecpp0 -E

Similarly, for the other sample drivers you can use:

    Driver                      PPD File
    --------------------------  ------------
    HP DeskJet Series           deskjet.ppd
    HP LaserJet Series          laserjet.ppd
    EPSON Stylus Color Series   stcolor.ppd
    EPSON Stylus Photo Series   stphoto.ppd
    EPSON 9-pin Series          epson9.ppd
    EPSON 24-pin Series         epson24.ppd

These sample drivers provide basic printing capabilities, but generally
do not exercise the full potential of the printers or CUPS.  For
commercial printer drivers check out our ESP Print Pro software at:

    http://www.easysw.com/printpro


PRINTING FILES

CUPS provides both the System V "lp" and Berkeley "lpr" commands for
printing:

    lp filename
    lpr filename

Both the "lp" and "lpr" commands support printing options for the
driver:

    lp -omedia=A4 -oresolution=600dpi filename
    lpr -omedia=A4 -oresolution=600dpi filename

CUPS recognizes many types of images files as well as PDF, PostScript,
HP-GL/2, and text files, so you can print those files directly rather
than through an application.

If you have an application that generates output specifically for your
printer then you need to use the "-oraw" or "-l" options:

    lp -oraw filename
    lpr -l filename

This will prevent the filters from misinterpreting your print file.


REPORTING PROBLEMS

If you have problems, READ THE DOCUMENTATION FIRST!  If the
documentation does not solve your problems please send an email to
cups-support@cups.org.  Include your operating system and version,
compiler and version, and any errors or problems you've run into. The
/var/log/error_log file should also be sent, as it often helps to
determine the cause of your problem.

If you are running a version of Linux, be sure to provide the Linux
distribution you have, too.

Please note that the "cups-support@cups.org" email address goes to the
CUPS developers; they are busy people, so your email may go unanswered
for days or weeks.  Commercial support (with a guaranteed response
time) is available from Easy Software Products.

You can subscribe to the CUPS mailing list by sending a message
containing "subscribe cups" to majordomo@cups.org.  This list is
