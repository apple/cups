INTRODUCTION

The Common UNIX Printing System provides a portable printing layer for
UNIX® operating systems.  It has been developed by Easy Software
Products to promote a standard printing solution for all UNIX vendors
and users.  CUPS provides the System V and Berkeley command-line
interfaces.

CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol (IETF-IPP) as the basis for
managing print jobs and queues.  The Line Printer Daemon (LPD,
RFC1179), Server Message Block (SMB), and AppSocket protocols are also
supported with reduced functionality.

CUPS adds network printer browsing and PostScript Printer Description
("PPD")-based printing options to support real world applications under
UNIX.

CUPS also includes a customized version of GNU GhostScript (currently
based off GNU GhostScript 4.03) and an image file RIP that can be used
to support non-PostScript printers.

CUPS is Copyright 1993-1999 by Easy Software Products, All Rights
Reserved.  CUPS is currently licensed under the terms of the GNU
General Public License.  Please see the license file for details.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Binary distributions require a minimum of 10MB of free disk space. We
do not recommend using CUPS on a workstation with less than 32MB of RAM
or a PC with less than 16MB of RAM.

If you are installing from source you'll need an ANSI C compiler and
optionally one or more image file support libraries.  Complete source
installation instructions can be found in the CUPS System
Administrator's Manual in the files "doc/sam.html" or "doc/sam.pdf".


SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

The following operating system software is required to install one of
the binary distributions from Easy Software Products:

    - Digital UNIX (aka OSF1 aka Compaq Tru64 UNIX) 4.0 or higher
    - HP-UX 10.20 or higher
    - IRIX 5.3 or higher
    - Linux 2.0 with glibc2 or higher (tested with RedHat 5.2)
    - Solaris 2.5 or higher (SPARC or Intel)


INSTALLING CUPS

We are currently distributing CUPS binary distributions in TAR format
with installation and removal scripts generated by our ESP Package
Manager (EPM) software, which is also included with the source
distribution.

WARNING: Installing CUPS will overwrite your existing printing system.
Backup files are made by the installation script and restored by the
removal script, so if you experience problems you should be able to
remove the CUPS software to restore your previous configuration. 
However, Easy Software Products makes no warranty for this and will not
be liable for any lost revenues, etc.

To install the CUPS software you will need to be logged in as root
(doing an "su" is good enough).  Once you are the root user, run the
installation script with:

    ./cups.install ENTER

After asking you a few yes/no questions the CUPS software will be
installed and the scheduler will be started automatically.


SETTING UP PRINTER QUEUES

CUPS works best with PPD (PostScript Printer Description) files.  In a
pinch you can also use System V style printer interface scripts.

Two sample PPD files are provided with this distribution that utilize
the PostScript and image file RIPs and the sample HP printer driver. 
To add the sample DeskJet driver to the system for a printer connected
to the parallel port, use one of the following commands:

    Digital UNIX:

        /usr/lib/lpadmin -p DeskJet -m deskjet.ppd -v parallel:/dev/lp0 -E

    HP-UX:

        /usr/lib/lpadmin -p DeskJet -m deskjet.ppd -v parallel:/dev/c2t0d0_lp -E

    IRIX:

        /usr/lib/lpadmin -p DeskJet -m deskjet.ppd -v parallel:/dev/plp -E

    Linux:

        /usr/lib/lpadmin -p DeskJet -m deskjet.ppd -v parallel:/dev/par0 -E
        /usr/lib/lpadmin -p DeskJet -m deskjet.ppd -v parallel:/dev/par1 -E
        /usr/lib/lpadmin -p DeskJet -m deskjet.ppd -v parallel:/dev/par2 -E

    Solaris:

        /usr/lib/lpadmin -p DeskJet -m deskjet.ppd -v parallel:/dev/bpp0 -E
        /usr/lib/lpadmin -p DeskJet -m deskjet.ppd -v parallel:/dev/ecpp0 -E

Similarly, for the sample LaserJet driver you can use "LaserJet" and
"laserjet.ppd".

For other printers and interfaces see the CUPS System Administator's
Manual included with this software.

PRINTING FILES

CUPS provides both the System V "lp" and Berkeley "lpr" commands for
printing:

    lp filename
    lpr filename

Both the "lp" and "lpr" commands support printing options for the
driver:

    lp -omedia=A4 -oresolution=600dpi filename
    lpr -omedia=A4 -oresolution=600dpi filename

CUPS recognizes many types of images files as well as PostScript, HP-GL/2,
and text files, so you can print those files directly rather than through
an application.

If you have an application that generates output specifically for your
printer then you need to use the "-oraw" or "-l" options:

    lp -oraw filename
    lpr -l filename

This will prevent the filters from misinterpreting your print file.


REPORTING PROBLEMS

If you have problems, please send an email to cups-support@cups.org. 
Include your operating system and version, compiler and version, and
any errors or problems you've run into.
