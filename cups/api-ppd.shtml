<h2 class='title'>Introduction</h2>

<p>The CUPS PPD API provides read-only access the data in
PostScript Printer Description ("PPD") files. With it you can
display printer options to users, mark option choices and check
for conflicting choices, and output marked choices in PostScript
output.</p>

<h2 class='title'>General Usage</h2>

<p>The <var>&lt;cups/ppd.h&gt;</var> header file must be included
to use the <tt>ppd</tt> functions.</p>

<p>Programs using these functions must be linked to the CUPS
library: <var>libcups.a</var>, <var>libcups.so.2</var>,
<var>libcups.2.dylib</var>, <var>libcups_s.a</var>, or
<var>libcups2.lib</var> depending on the platform. The following
command compiles <var>myprogram.c</var> using GCC and the CUPS
library:</p>

<pre class='command'>
<kbd>gcc -o myprogram myprogram.c -lcups</kbd>
</pre>

<h2 class='title'>Compatibility</h2>

<p>Unless otherwise specified, the PPD API functions require CUPS
1.1 or higher.</p>
