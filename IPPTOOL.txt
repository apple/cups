IPPTOOL.txt - 2011-05-20
------------------------


INTRODUCTION

    Starting with CUPS 1.5, CUPS now installs a user program called ipptool that
    can be used to send arbitrary IPP requests to a CUPS server or IPP printer.
    This tool started life as part of the CUPS automated test suite and has
    grown to support complex conformance tests and a simple way to query
    printer, job, and subscription attributes.


BASIC USAGE

    The ipptool command requires a printer URI and one or more "test" files that
    describe the operations, attributes to display, and expected status and
    attribute values. Several standard files are included with CUPS, for example
    to show a list of pending print jobs on a CUPS printer called "myprinter"
    you'd run:

        ipptool ipp://localhost/printers/myprinter get-jobs.test

    which would produce something like this:

	job-id job-state    job-name     job-originating-user-name
	------ ------------ ------------ -------------------------
	72     pending      testfile.pdf msweet
	73     pending      testfile.ps  msweet
	74     pending-held testfile.jpg msweet
	75     pending-held testfile.txt msweet

    To get output suitable for import into a spreadsheet, use the "-c" (CSV)
    option:

        ipptool -c ipp://localhost/printers/myprinter get-jobs.test

    which would produce something like this:

	job-id,job-state,job-name,job-originating-user-name
	72,pending,testfile.pdf,msweet
	73,pending,testfile.ps,msweet
	74,pending-held,testfile.jpg,msweet
	75,pending-held,testfile.txt,msweet


CONFORMANCE TESTS

    We provide basic IPP conformance tests for IPP/1.1, IPP/2.0, and IPP/2.1.
    For a given printer URI, the following commands perform tests at each level:

        ipptool -t printer-uri ipp-1.1.test
        ipptool -t -V 2.0 printer-uri ipp-2.0.test
        ipptool -t -V 2.1 printer-uri ipp-2.1.test


READING THE DOCUMENTATION

    The command usage is described in the ipptest(1) man page, while the file
    format is described in the ipptestfile(5) man page.
