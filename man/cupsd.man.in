.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIcupsd\fR is the scheduler for CUPS. It implements a printing system based
upon the Internet Printing Protocol, version 2.1.  If no options are specified
on the command-line then the default configuration file
\fI@CUPS_SERVERROOT@/cupsd.conf\fR will be used.

.TP 5
-f

Run \fIcupsd\fR in the foreground; the default is to run in the
background as a "daemon".
.TP 5
-F
.br
Run \fIcupsd\fR in the foreground but detach the process from the
controlling terminal and current directory. This is useful for
running \fIcupsd\fR from \fIinit(8)\fR.
.TP 5
-h
.br
Shows the program usage.
.TP 5
-l

This option is passed to \fIcupsd\fR when it is run from

Test the configuration file for syntax errors.
.SH COMPATIBILITY

operations. It also implements several CUPS-specific administration
operations.
