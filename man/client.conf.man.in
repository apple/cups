.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBclient.conf\fR file configures the CUPS client and is normally located in the \fI/etc/cups\fR and/or \fI~/.cups\fR directories.
Each line in the file can be a configuration directive, a blank line, or a comment. Comment lines start with the # character.

The \fBServerName\fR directive is not supported on OS X at all.

The \fIAllowSSL3\fR option enables SSL v3.0, which is required for some older clients that do not support TLS v1.0.
