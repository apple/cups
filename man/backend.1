       The  CUPS backend interface provides a standard method for
       sending document files to different physical interfaces.

       Backends must be capable of reading from a filename on the
       command-line  or from the standard input, copying stdin to
       a temporary if required by the physical interface.

       The command name (argv[0]) is set to the device URI of the
       destination printer.

       The  following  environment  variables  are defined by the
       CUPS server when executing the backend:

       CHARSET
            The default text character set (typically us-ascii or
            iso-8859-1).

       CONTENT_TYPE
            The MIME type associated with the file (e.g. applica-
            tion/postscript).

       DEVICE_URI
            The device-uri associated with the printer;  this  is
            provided  for  shell scripts which may not be able to
            get the passed argv[0] string.

       LANG
            The default language locale (typically C or en).

       PATH
            The standard execution  path  for  external  programs
            that may be run by the backend.

       PPD
            The  full pathname of the PostScript Printer Descrip-
            tion (PPD) file for this printer.

       PRINTER
            The name of the printer.

       RIP_CACHE
            The recommended amount of memory to  use  for  Raster
            Image Processors (RIPs).

       SERVER_ROOT
            The root directory of the server.
