# different functionality then a different name is used to avoid       #

######## Filter Options
########

#
# User/Group: the user and group the server runs under.  Normally this
# must be lp and sys, however you can configure things for another user
# or group as needed.
#
# Note: the server must be run initially as root to support the
# default IPP port of 631.  It changes users whenever an external
# program is run...
#

#User lp
#Group sys

#

# bitmaps.  The value can be any real number followed by "k" for

#
# FilterLimit: sets the maximum cost of all job filters that can be run

# a filter limit of at least 200; limits less than the minimum required
# by a job force a single job to be printed at any time.
#
# The default limit is 0 (unlimited).
#

#FilterLimit 0

########
######## Network Options
########

#
# Ports/addresses that we listen to.  The default port 631 is reserved
# for the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) and is what we use here.
#
# You can have multiple Port/Listen lines to listen to more than one
# port or address, or to restrict access:
#
#    Port 80
#    Port 631
#    Listen hostname
#    Listen hostname:80
#    Listen hostname:631
#    Listen 1.2.3.4
#    Listen 1.2.3.4:631
# 
# NOTE: Unfortunately, most web browsers don't support TLS or HTTP Upgrades
# for encryption.  If you want to support web-based encryption you'll
# probably need to listen on port 443 (the "https" port...)
#

#Port 80
#Port 443
Port 631

#
# HostNameLookups: whether or not to do lookups on IP addresses to get a
# fully-qualified hostname.  This defaults to Off for performance reasons...
#

#HostNameLookups On

#
# KeepAlive: whether or not to support the Keep-Alive connection
# option.  Default is on.
#

#KeepAlive On

#
# KeepAliveTimeout: the timeout before Keep-Alive connections are
# automatically closed.  Default is 60 seconds.
#

#KeepAliveTimeout 60

#
# MaxClients: controls the maximum number of simultaneous clients that
# will be handled.  Defaults to 100.
#

#MaxClients 100

#
# MaxRequestSize: controls the maximum size of HTTP requests and print files.
# Set to 0 to disable this feature (defaults to 0.)
#

#MaxRequestSize 0

#
# Timeout: the timeout before requests time out.  Default is 300 seconds.
#

#Timeout 300


########
######## Browsing Options
########

#
# Browsing: whether or not to broadcast and/or listen for CUPS printer
# information on the network.  Enabled by default.
#

#Browsing On

#
# BrowseAddress: specifies a broadcast address to be used.  By
# default browsing information is not sent!
#
# Note: HP-UX does not properly handle broadcast unless you have a
# Class A, B, C, or D netmask (i.e. no CIDR support).
#
# Note: Using the "global" broadcast address (255.255.255.255) will
# activate a Linux demand-dial link with the default configuration.
# If you have a LAN as well as the dial-up link, use the LAN's
# broadcast address.
#

#BrowseAddress x.y.z.255
#BrowseAddress x.y.255.255
#BrowseAddress x.255.255.255
#BrowseAddress 255.255.255.255

#
# BrowseShortNames: whether or not to use "short" names for remote printers
# when possible (e.g. "printer" instead of "printer@host".)  Enabled by
# default.
#

#BrowseShortNames Yes

#
# BrowseAllow: specifies an address mask to allow for incoming browser
# packets. The default is to allow packets from all addresses.
#
# BrowseDeny: specifies an address mask to deny for incoming browser
# packets. The default is to deny packets from no addresses.
#
# Both "BrowseAllow" and "BrowseDeny" accept the following notations for
# addresses:
#
#     All
#     None
#     *.domain.com
#     .domain.com
#     host.domain.com
#     nnn.*
#     nnn.nnn.*
#     nnn.nnn.nnn.*
#     nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn
#     nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn/mm
#     nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn/mmm.mmm.mmm.mmm
#
# The hostname/domainname restrictions only work if you have turned hostname
# lookups on!
#

#BrowseAllow address
#BrowseDeny address

#
# BrowseInterval: the time between browsing updates in seconds.  Default
# is 30 seconds.
#
# Note that browsing information is sent whenever a printer's state changes
# as well, so this represents the maximum time between updates.
#
# Set this to 0 to disable outgoing broadcasts so your local printers are
# not advertised but you can still see printers on other hosts.
#

#BrowseInterval 30

#
# BrowseOrder: specifies the order of BrowseAllow/BrowseDeny comparisons.
#

#BrowseOrder allow,deny
#BrowseOrder deny,allow

#
# BrowsePoll: poll the named server(s) for printers
#

#BrowsePoll address:port

#
# BrowsePort: the port used for UDP broadcasts.  By default this is
# the IPP port; if you change this you need to do it on all servers.
# Only one BrowsePort is recognized.
#

#BrowsePort 631

#
# BrowseRelay: relay browser packets from one address/network to another.
#

#BrowseRelay source-address destination-address

#
# BrowseTimeout: the timeout for network printers - if we don't
# get an update within this time the printer will be removed
# from the printer list.  This number definitely should not be
# less the BrowseInterval value for obvious reasons.  Defaults
# to 300 seconds.
#

#BrowseTimeout 300

#
# ImplicitClasses: whether or not to use implicit classes.
#
# Printer classes can be specified explicitly in the classes.conf
# file, implicitly based upon the printers available on the LAN, or
# both.
#
# When ImplicitClasses is On, printers on the LAN with the same name
# (e.g. Acme-LaserPrint-1000) will be put into a class with the same
# name. This allows you to setup multiple redundant queues on a LAN
# without a lot of administrative difficulties.  If a user sends a
# job to Acme-LaserPrint-1000, the job will go to the first available
# queue.
#
# Enabled by default.
#

#ImplicitClasses On


########
######## Security Options
########

#
# SystemGroup: the group name for "System" (printer administration)
# access.  The default varies depending on the operating system, but
# will be "sys", "system", or "root" (checked for in that order.)
#

#SystemGroup sys

#
# Access permissions for each directory served by the scheduler.
# Locations are relative to DocumentRoot...
#
# AuthType: the authorization to use:
#
#    None   - Perform no authentication
#    Basic  - Perform authentication using the HTTP Basic method.
#    Digest - Perform authentication using the HTTP Digest method.
#
#    (Note: local certificate authentication can be substituted by
#           the client for Basic or Digest when connecting to the
#           localhost interface)
#
# AuthClass: the authorization class; currently only "Anonymous", "User",
# "System" (valid user belonging to group SystemGroup), and "Group"
# (valid user belonging to the specified group) are supported.
#
# AuthGroupName: the group name for "Group" authorization.
#
# Order: the order of Allow/Deny processing.
#
# Allow: allows access from the specified hostname, domain, IP address, or
# network.
#
# Deny: denies access from the specified hostname, domain, IP address, or
# network.
#
# Both "Allow" and "Deny" accept the following notations for addresses:
#
#     All
#     None
#     *.domain.com
#     .domain.com
#     host.domain.com
#     nnn.*
#     nnn.nnn.*
#     nnn.nnn.nnn.*
#     nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn
#     nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn/mm
#     nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn/mmm.mmm.mmm.mmm
#
# The host and domain address require that you enable hostname lookups
# with "HostNameLookups On" above.
#
# Encryption: whether or not to use encryption; this depends on having
# the OpenSSL library linked into the CUPS library and scheduler.
#
# Possible values:
#
#     Always       - Always use encryption (SSL)
#     Never        - Never use encryption
#     Required     - Use TLS encryption upgrade
#     IfRequested  - Use encryption if the server requests it
#
# The default value is "IfRequested".
