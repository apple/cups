# This is the CUPS configuration file.  If you are familiar with       #
# Apache or any of the other popular web servers, we've followed the   #
# same format.  Any configuration variable used here has the same      #
# semantics as the corresponding variable in Apache.  If we need       #
# different functionality then a different name is used to avoid       #
# confusion...                                                         #

#
# Ports/addresses that we listen to.  The default port 631 is reserved
# for the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) and is what we use here.
#
# You can have multiple Port/Listen lines to listen to more than one
# port or address, or to restrict access:
#
#    Port 80
#    Port 631
#    Listen hostname
#    Listen hostname:80
#    Listen hostname:631
#    Listen 1.2.3.4
#    Listen 1.2.3.4:631
# 

#Port 80
Port 631

#
# MaxClients: controls the maximum number of simultaneous clients that
# will be handled.  Defaults to 100.
#

#MaxClients 100

#
# User/Group: the user and group the server runs under.  Normally this
# must be lp and sys, however you can configure things for another user
# or group as needed.
#
# Note: the server must be run initially as root to support the
# default IPP port of 631.  It changes users whenever an external
# program is run...
#

User lp
Group sys

#
# SystemGroup: the group name for "System" (printer administration)
# access.
#

SystemGroup sys

#
# ServerName: the hostname of your server, as advertised to the world.
# By default CUPS will use the hostname of the system.
#

#ServerName myhost.domain.com

#
# ServerAdmin: the email address to send all complaints/problems to.
# By default CUPS will use "root@hostname".
#

#ServerAdmin root@your.domain.com

#
# ServerRoot: the root directory for the scheduler.
# By default the compiled-in value.
#

#ServerRoot /var/cups

#
# AccessLog: the access log file; if this does not start with a leading /
# then it is assumed to be relative to ServerRoot.  By default set to
# "logs/access_log"
#

#AccessLog logs/access_log

#
# ErrorLog: the error log file; if this does not start with a leading /
# then it is assumed to be relative to ServerRoot.  By default set to
# "logs/error_log"
#

#ErrorLog logs/error_log

#
# PageLog: the page log file; if this does not start with a leading /
# then it is assumed to be relative to ServerRoot.  By default set to
# "logs/page_log"
#

#PageLog logs/page_log

#
# LogLevel: controls the number of messages logged to the ErrorLog
# file and can be one of the following:
#
#     debug	Log everything.
#     info      Log all requests and state changes.
#     warn      Log errors and warnings.
#     error     Log only errors.
#     none      Log nothing.
#

LogLevel info

#
# MaxLogSize: controls the maximum size of each log file before they are
# rotated.  Defaults to 1048576 (1MB).  Set to 0 to disable log rotating.
#

#MaxLogSize 0

#
# MaxRequestSize: controls the maximum size of print files.  Set to 0 to
# disable this feature (defaults to 0.)
#

#MaxRequestSize 0

#
# HostNameLookups: whether or not to do lookups on IP addresses to get a
# fully-qualified hostname.  This defaults to Off for performance reasons...
#

#HostNameLookups On

#
# Timeout: the timeout before requests time out.  Default is 300 seconds.
#

#Timeout 300

#
# KeepAlive: whether or not to support the Keep-Alive connection
# option.  Default is on.
#

#KeepAlive On

#
# KeepAliveTimeout: the timeout before Keep-Alive connections are
# automatically closed.  Default is 60 seconds.
#

#KeepAliveTimeout 60

#
# ImplicitClasses: whether or not to use implicit classes.
#
# Printer classes can be specified explicitly in the classes.conf
# file, implicitly based upon the printers available on the LAN, or
# both.
#
# When ImplicitClasses is On, printers on the LAN with the same name
# (e.g. Acme-LaserPrint-1000) will be put into a class with the same
# name. This allows you to setup multiple redundant queues on a LAN
# without a lot of administrative difficulties.  If a user sends a
# job to Acme-LaserPrint-1000, the job will go to the first available
# queue.
#
# Enabled by default.
#

#ImplicitClasses On

#
# Browsing: whether or not to broadcast printer information to
# other CUPS servers.  Enabled by default.
#

#Browsing On

#
# BrowseInterval: the time between browsing updates in seconds.  Default
# is 30 seconds.
#
# Note that browsing information is sent whenever a printer's state changes
# as well, so this represents the maximum time between updates.
#

#BrowseInterval 30

#
# BrowseTimeout: the timeout for network printers - if we don't
# get an update within this time the printer will be removed
# from the printer list.  This number definitely should not be
# less the BrowseInterval value for obvious reasons.  Defaults
# to 300 seconds.
#

#BrowseTimeout 300

#
# BrowsePort: the port used for UDP broadcasts.  By default this is
# the IPP port; if you change this you need to do it on all servers.
# Only one BrowsePort is recognized.
#

#BrowsePort 631

#
# BrowseAddress: specifies a broadcast address to be used.  By
# default browsing information is broadcast to all active interfaces.
#
# Note: HP-UX 10.20 and earlier do not properly handle broadcast unless
# you have a Class A, B, C, or D netmask (i.e. no CIDR support).
#

#BrowseAddress x.y.z.255
#BrowseAddress x.y.255.255
#BrowseAddress x.255.255.255

#
# DocumentRoot: the root directory for HTTP documents that are served.
# By default the compiled in directory.
#

#DocumentRoot /usr/share/cups/doc

#
# DefaultLanguage: the default language if not specified by the browser.
# If not specified, the current locale is used.
#

#DefaultLanguage en

#
# DefaultCharset: the default character set to use. If not specified,
# defaults to iso-8859-1.  Note that this can also be overridden in
# HTML documents...
#

#DefaultCharset iso-8859-1

#
# RIPCache: the amount of memory that each RIP should use to cache
# bitmaps.  The value can be any real number followed by "k" for
# kilobytes, "m" for megabytes, "g" for gigabytes, or "t" for tiles
# (1 tile = 256x256 pixels.)  Defaults to "8m" (8 megabytes).
#

#RIPCache 8m

#
# TempDir: the directory to put temporary files in. This directory must be
# writable by the user defined above!  Defaults to "/var/tmp" or the value
# of the TMPDIR environment variable.
#

#TempDir /var/tmp

#
# Access permissions for each directory served by the scheduler.
# Locations are relative to DocumentRoot...
#
# AuthType: the authorization to use; currently only "Basic" authorization is
# supported.
#
# AuthClass: the authorization class; currently only "Anonymous", "User",
# "System" (valid user belonging to group SystemGroup), and "Group"
# (valid user belonging to the specified group) are supported.
#
# AuthGroupName: the group name for "Group" authorization.
#
# Order: the order of Allow/Deny processing.
#
# Allow: allows access from the specified hostname, domain, IP address, or
# network.
#
# Deny: denies access from the specified hostname, domain, IP address, or
# network.
#
# Both "Allow" and "Deny" accept the following notations for addresses:
#
#     All
#     None
#     *.domain.com
#     .domain.com
#     host.domain.com
#     nnn.*
#     nnn.nnn.*
#     nnn.nnn.nnn.*
#     nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn
#     nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn/mm
#     nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn/mmm.mmm.mmm.mmm
#
# The host and domain address require that you enable hostname lookups
# with "HostNameLookups On" above.
#

<Location />
</Location>

<Location /printers>
#
# You may wish to limit access to printers and classes, either with Allow
# and Deny lines, or by requiring a username and password.
#

## Require a username and password
#AuthType Basic
#AuthClass User

## Restrict access to local domain
#Order Deny,Allow
#Deny From All
#Allow From .mydomain.com
</Location>

<Location /admin>
#
# You definitely will want to limit access to the administration tools.
# The default configuration requires a local connection from a user who
# is a member of group "sys" to do any admin tasks.  You can change the
# group name using the SystemGroup directive.
#

AuthType Basic
AuthClass System

## Restrict access to local domain
