%   HP-GL/2 filter procset for the Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS).
%
%   This procset contains the basic drawing commands that are used to
%   reduce output size.  Note the 'MP' (make newpath) definition - this
%   should be called 'NP' (newpath), but GhostScript uses the 'NP' name
%   for 'noaccess put' in some of its font files...
