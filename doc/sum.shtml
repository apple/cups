<H1 ALIGN=RIGHT>Preface</H1>

This software users manual describes how to use the Common UNIX Printing
System ("CUPS") Version 1.0.0.

<H2>System Overview</H2>

The Common UNIX Printing System provides a portable printing layer for 
UNIX&reg; operating systems. It has been developed by Easy Software 
Products to promote a standard printing solution for all UNIX vendors 
and users. CUPS provides the System V and Berkeley command-line interfaces.

<P>CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol (IETF-IPP) as the basis
for managing print jobs and queues. The Line Printer Daemon (LPD,
RFC1179), Server Message Block (SMB), and AppSocket protocols are also
supported with reduced functionality.

<P>CUPS adds network printer browsing and PostScript Printer
Description (&quot;PPD&quot;)-based printing options to support real
world applications under UNIX.

<P>CUPS also includes a customized version of GNU GhostScript
(currently based off GNU GhostScript 4.03) and an image file RIP that
can be used to support non-PostScript printers.

<H1 ALIGN=RIGHT>1 - Printing System Overview</H1>

<P>This chapter provides an overview of how the Common UNIX Printing System
works.

<H2>The Printing Problem</H2>

<P>For years <I>the printing problem</I> has plagued UNIX&reg;. Unlike
Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; or MacOS, UNIX has no standard interface or
system in place for supporting printers. Among the solutions previously
available, the Berkeley and System V printing systems are the most
prevalent.

<P>These printing systems support line printers (text only) or
PostScript printers (text and graphics), and with some coaxing they can
be made to support a full range of printers and file formats. However,
because each varient of the UNIX operating system uses a different
printing system than the next, developing printer drivers for a wide
range of printers is extremely difficult. That combined with the
limited volume of customers for each UNIX varient has forced most
printer vendors to give up supporting UNIX entirely.

<P>The Common UNIX Printing System, or CUPS, is designed to eliminate
<I>the printing problem</I>. One common printing system can be used by
all UNIX varients to support the printing needs of users. Printer
vendors can use its modular filter interface to develop a single driver
program that supports a wide range of file formats with little or no
effort.  Since CUPS provides both the System V and Berkeley printing
commands, users (and applications) can reap the benefits of this new
technology with no changes.

<H2>The Technology</H2>

<P>CUPS is based upon an emerging Internet standard called the Internet
Printing Protocol, or IPP. IPP has been embraced by dozens of printer
and printer server manufacturers, and will be supported by the next
Microsoft Windows operating system.

<P>IPP defines a standard protocol for printing as well as managing print
jobs and printer options like media size, resolution, and so forth. Like all
IP-based protocols, IPP can be used locally or over the Internet to printers
hundreds or thousands of miles away. Unlike other protocols, however, IPP
also supports access control, authentication, and encryption, making it a
much more secure printing solution than older ones.

<P>IPP is layered on top of the Hyper-Text Transport Protocol, or HTTP,
which is the basis of web servers on the Internet. This allows the user to
view documentation and status information on a printer or server using their
web browser.

<P>CUPS provides a complete IPP/1.0-based printing system that provides Basic
authentication and domain or IP-based access control. Digest authentication
and TLS encryption will be available in future versions of CUPS.

<H2>Jobs</H2>

<P>Each file that is submitted for printing is called a <I>job</I>. 
Jobs are identified by a unique number starting at 1 and are assigned
to a particular destination (usually a printer). Jobs can also have
options associated with them such as media size, number of copies, and
priority.

<H2>Classes</H2>

<P>CUPS supports collections of printers known as <I>classes</I>. Jobs sent
to a class are forwarded to the first available printer in the class.

<H2>Filters</H2>

<P>Filters allow a user or application to print many types of files
without extra effort. Print jobs sent to a CUPS server are filtered
before sending them to a printer. Some filters convert job files to
different formats that the printer can understand. Others perform page
selection and ordering tasks. <I>Backend</I> filters perform the most
important task of all - they send the filtered print data to the
printer.

<P>CUPS provides filters for printing many types of image files,
HP-GL/2 files, PDF files, and text files. CUPS also supplies
PostScript and image file Raster Image Processors, or RIPs, that
convert PostScript or image files into bitmaps that can be sent to a
raster printer.

<P>CUPS provides backends for printing over parallel and serial ports,
and over the network via the JetDirect (AppSocket), Server Message
Block, and Line Printer Daemon protocols.

<H2>Printer Drivers</H2>

<P>Printer drivers in CUPS consist of one of more filters specific to a
printer. CUPS includes a sample printer driver for Hewlett-Packard
LaserJet and DeskJet printers. While this driver does not generate
optimal output for different printer models, it does demonstrate how
you can write your own printer drivers and incorporate them into CUPS.

<H2>Networking</H2>

<P>Printers and classes on the local system are automatically shared with
other systems on the network. This allows you to setup one system to print
to a printer and use this system as a printer server or spool host for all
of the others.  If there is only one occurrence of a printer on a network,
then that printer can be accessed using its name alone. If more than one
printer exists with the same name, users must select the printer by specifying
which server to use (e.g. "printer@host1" or "printer@host2".)

<P>CUPS also provides <I>implicit classes</I>, which are collections of
printers and/or classes with the same name. This allows you to setup multiple
servers pointing to the same physical network printer, for example, so that
you aren't relying on a single system for printing. Because this also works
with printer classes, you can setup multiple servers and printers and never
worry about a "single point of failure" unless all of the printers and servers
goes down!

<H1 ALIGN=RIGHT>2 - Using the Printing System</H1>

<P>This chapter shows you how to submit, query, and cancel print jobs to
different printers.

<H2>Submitting Files for Printing</H2>

<P>CUPS provides both the System V (<CODE>lp</CODE>) and Berkeley
(<CODE>lpr</CODE>) printing commands. To print a file to the default printer
on the system (or your only printer if you have only one) you just need to
type:

<UL><PRE>
% lp filename ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>or:

<UL><PRE>
% lpr filename ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>CUPS understands many different types of files directly, including PostScript
and image files. This allows you to print from inside your applications or at
the command-line, whichever is most convenient!

<H2>Choosing a Printer</H2>

<P>Many systems will have more than one printer available to the user. These
printers can be attached to the local system via a parallel or serial port,
or available over the network.

<P>To see a list of available printers, use the <CODE>lpstat</CODE> command:

<UL><PRE>
% lpstat -p -d ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>The "-p" option specifies that you want to see a list of printers, and the
"-d" option reports the current system default printer or class.

<P>To print to a specific printer, use the "-d" option to the <CODE>lp</CODE>
command:

<UL><PRE>
% lp -d printer filename ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>or the "-P" option to the <CODE>lpr</CODE> command:

<UL><PRE>
% lpr -P printer filename ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<H2>Setting Printer Options</H2>

<P>For many types of files, the default printer options may be sufficient for
your needs. However, there may be times when you need to change the options
for a particular file you are printing.

<P>The <CODE>lp</CODE> command allows you to pass printer options using the
"-o" option:

<UL><PRE>
% lp -o landscape -o scaling=75 -o media=A4 filename.jpg
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <CODE>lpr</CODE> command has no command-line option for printer options.

<P>The available printer options vary depending on the printer. The standard
options are described in <A HREF="#4">Chapter 3</A>.

<H2>Printing Multiple Copies</H2>

<P>Both the <CODE>lp</CODE> and <CODE>lpr</CODE> commands have options for
printing more than one copy of a file:

<UL><PRE>
% lp -n num-copies filename ENTER
% lpr -#num-copies filename ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>Copies are normally <I>not</I> collated for you. To get collated copies
use the <CODE>lp</CODE> command with the "-o Collate=True" option:

<UL><PRE>
% lp -n num-copies -o Collate=True filename ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<H2>Checking the Printer Status from the Command-Line</H2>

<P>The <CODE>lpstat</CODE> command can be used to check for jobs that you
have submitted for printing:

<UL><PRE>
% lpstat ENTER
Printer-1 johndoe 4427776
Printer-2 johndoe 15786
Printer-3 johndoe 372842
</PRE></UL>

<P>The jobs are listed in the order they will be printed. To see which files
and printers are active, use the "-p" option:

<UL><PRE>
% lpstat -p ENTER
printer DeskJet now printing DeskJet-1.
</PRE></UL>

<P>Or to show the jobs and the printers, use the "-o" and "-p" options:

<UL><PRE>
% lpstat -o -p ENTER
Printer-1 johndoe 4427776
Printer-2 johndoe 15786
Printer-3 johndoe 372842
printer DeskJet now printing DeskJet-1.
</PRE></UL>

<H2>Checking the Printer Status from the Web</H2>

<P>Since CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol, it is also a
full-featured web server. To use your web browser to monitor the
printers on your system, open the URL
"<A HREF="http://localhost:631">http://localhost:631</A>". From there
you can view the status of classes, jobs, and printers with the click
of a button!

<H2>Canceling a Print Job</H2>

<P>The <CODE>cancel</CODE> command cancels a print job:

<UL><PRE>
% cancel job-id ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <I>job-id</I> is a number that was reported to you by the
<CODE>lp</CODE> or <CODE>lpstat</CODE> commands.

<H1 ALIGN=RIGHT>3 - Standard Printer Options</H1>

<P>This chapter describes the standard printer options that are available
when printing with the <CODE>lp</CODE> command.

<H2>General Options</H2>

<P>The following options apply when printing all types of files.

<H3>Selecting the Media Size, Type, and Source</H3>

<P>The "-o media=xyz" option sets the media size, type, and/or source:

<UL><PRE>
% lp -o media=Letter filename ENTER
% lp -o media=Letter,MultiPurpose filename ENTER
% lp -o media=Letter,Transparency filename ENTER
% lp -o media=Letter,MultiPurpose,Transparency filename ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>The available media sizes, types, and sources depend on the printer, but
most support the following options (case is significant):

<UL>

	<LI><CODE>Letter</CODE> - US Letter (8.5x11 inches, or 216x279mm)

	<LI><CODE>Legal</CODE> - US Legal (8.5x14 inches, or 216x356mm)

	<LI><CODE>A4</CODE> - ISO A4 (8.27x11.69 inches, or 210x297mm)

	<LI><CODE>COM10</CODE> - US #10 Envelope (9.5x4.125 inches, or

	<LI><CODE>DL</CODE> - ISO DL Envelope (8.66x4.33 inches, or 220x110mm)

	<LI><CODE>Transparency</CODE> - Transparency media type or source

	<LI><CODE>Upper</CODE> - Upper paper tray

	<LI><CODE>Lower</CODE> - Lower paper tray

	<LI><CODE>MultiPurpose</CODE> - Multi-purpose paper tray

	<LI><CODE>LargeCapacity</CODE> - Large capacity paper tray

</UL>

<P>The actual options supported are defined in the printer's PPD file in the
<CODE>PageSize</CODE>, <CODE>InputSlot</CODE>, and <CODE>MediaType</CODE>
options.

<H3>Setting the Orientation</H3>

<P>The "-o landscape" option will rotate the page 90 degrees to print in
landscape orientation:

<UL><PRE>
% lp -o landscape filename ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<H3>Printing On Both Sides of the Paper</H3>

<P>The "-o sides=two-sided-short" and "-o sides=two-sided-long" options will
enable duplexing on the printer (if the printer supports it.) The "two-sided-short"
option is suitable for landscape pages, while the "two-sided-long" option is
suitable for portrait pages:

<UL><PRE>
% lp -o sides=two-sided-short filename ENTER
% lp -o sides=two-sided-long filename ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<H3>Selecting a Range of Pages</H3>

<P>The "-o page-ranges=pages" option selects a range of pages for printing:

<UL><PRE>
% lp -o page-ranges=1 filename ENTER
% lp -o page-ranges=1-4 filename ENTER
% lp -o page-ranges=1-4,7,9-12 filename ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>As shown above, the <I>pages</I> value can be a single page, a range of
pages, or a collection of page numbers and ranges separated by commas. The
pages will always be printed in ascending order, regardless of the order of
the pages in the "page-range" option.

<P>To select the even or odd pages, use the "-o page-set=set" option:

<UL><PRE>
% lp -o page-set=odd filename ENTER
% lp -o page-set=even filename ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<H3>Setting the Brightness</H3>

<P>You can control the overall brightness of the printed output using the
"-o brightness=percent" option:

<UL><PRE>
% lp -o brightness=120 filename ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>Values greater than 100 will lighten the print, while values less than
100 will darken it.

<H3>Setting the Gamma Correction</H3>

<P>You can control the overall gamma correction of the printed output
using the "-o gamma=value" option:

<UL><PRE>
% lp -o gamma=1700 filename ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>Values greater than 1000 will lighten the print, while values less
than 1000 will darken it.

<H2>Text Options</H2>

<P>The following options apply when printing text files.

<H3>Setting the Number of Characters Per Inch</H3>

<P>The "-o cpi=value" option sets the number of characters per inch:

<UL><PRE>
% lp -o cpi=12 filename ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<H3>Setting the Number of Lines Per Inch</H3>

<P>The "-o lpi=value" option sets the number of lines per inch:

<UL><PRE>
% lp -o lpi=8 filename ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<H3>Setting the Number of Columns</H3>

<P>The "-o columns=value" option sets the number of text columns:

<UL><PRE>
% lp -o columns=2 filename ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<H3>Setting the Page Margins</H3>

<P>Normally the page margins are set to the hard limits of the printer. To
adjust the page margins use the "-o page-left=value", "-o page-right=value",
"-o page-top=value", and "-o page-bottom=value" options:

<UL><PRE>
% lp -o page-left=value filename ENTER
% lp -o page-right=value filename ENTER
% lp -o page-top=value filename ENTER
% lp -o page-bottom=value filename ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <I>value</I> argument is the margin in points; each point is 1/72 inch
or 0.35mm.

<H3>Pretty Printing</H3>

<P>The "-o prettyprint" option puts a header at the top of each page with the
page number, job title (usually the filename), and the date. Also, C and C++
keywords are highlighted, and comment lines are italicized:

<UL><PRE>
% lp -o prettyprint filename ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<H2>Image Options</H2>

<P>The following options apply when printing image files.

<H3>Scaling the Image</H3>

<P>The "-o scaling=percent" and "-o ppi=value" options change the size of a
printed image:

<UL><PRE>
% lp -o scaling=percent filename ENTER
% lp -o ppi=value filename ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>The scaling <I>percent</I> is a number from 1 to 800 specifying the size
in relation to the page (<I>not</I> the image.) A scaling of 100 percent will
fill the page as completely as the image aspect ratio allows. A scaling of
200 percent will print on up to 4 pages.

<P>The ppi <I>value</I> is a number from 1 to 1200 specifying the resolution
of the image in pixels per inch. An image that is 3000x2400 pixels will print
10x8 inches at 300 pixels per inch, for example. If the specified resolution
makes the image larger than the page, multiple pages will be printed to
satisfy the request.

<H3>Adjusting the Hue (Tint) of an Image</H3>

<P>The "-o hue=value" option will adjust the hue of the printed image, much
like the tint control on your television:

<UL><PRE>
% lp -o hue=value filename ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <I>value</I> argument is a number from -360 to 360 and represents the
color hue rotation. The following table summarizes the change you'll see with
different colors:

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="50%" BORDER="1">
<TR>
	<TH>Original</TH>
	<TH>hue=-45</TH>
	<TH>hue=45</TH>
</TR>

</TR>
<TR>
	<TD>Cyan</TD>
	<TD>Blue-green</TD>
	<TD>Light-navy-blue</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>

<H3>Adjusting the Saturation (Color) of an Image</H3>

<P>The "-o saturation=percent" option adjusts the saturation of the colors in
an image, much like the color knob on your television:

<UL><PRE>
% lp -o saturation=percent filename ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <I>percent</I> argument specifies the color saturation from 0 to 200.
A color saturation of 0 produces a black-and-white print, while a value of 200
will make the colors extremely intense.
