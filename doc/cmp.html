<H1>
Scope</H1>

<H2>
Identification</H2>
This configuration management plan document provides the guidelines for
development and maintainance of the Common UNIX Printing System ("CUPS")
Version 1.0 software.
<H2>
System Overview</H2>
The Common UNIX Printing System provides a portable printing layer for
UNIX&reg; operating systems. It has been developed by Easy Software Products
to promote a standard printing solution for all UNIX vendors and users.

<P>CUPS provides both the System V and Berkeley user interfaces and utilizes
the Internet Printing Protocol (IETF-IPP) as the basis for sending remote
print jobs. CUPS adds network printer browsing and PostScript Printer Description
("PPD")-based printing options to support real world applications under
UNIX.

<H1>
File Management</H1>

<H2>
Directory Structure</H2>
Each source file shall be placed a sub-directory corresponding to the software
sub-system it belongs to ("scheduler", "libcups", etc.) To remain compatible
with older UNIX filesystems, directory names shall not exceed 16 characters
in length.
<H2>
Source Files</H2>
Source files shall be documented and formatted as described in Appendix
B, Coding Requirements.
<H2>
Configuration Management</H2>
Source files shall be placed under the control of the Concurrent Versions
System ("CVS") software. Source files shall be "checked in" with each change
so that modifications can be tracked.

<P>Documentation on the CVS software is included with the whitepaper, "CVS
II: Parallelizing Software Development".
<H1>
Trouble Report Processing</H1>
A Software Trouble Report ("STR") shall be submitted every time a user
or vendor experiences a problem with the CUPS software. Trouble reports
are maintained in a database with one of the following states:
<OL>
<LI>
STR is closed with complete resolution</LI>

<LI>
STR is closed without resolution</LI>

<LI>
STR is active</LI>

<LI>
STR is pending (new STR or additional information available)</LI>
</OL>
Trouble reports shall be processed using the following steps.
<H2>
Classification</H2>
When a trouble report is received it must be classified at one of the following
levels:
<OL>
<LI>
Request for enhancement</LI>

<LI>
Documentation error</LI>

<LI>
Unable to print a file</LI>

<LI>
Unable to print to a printer</LI>

<LI>
Unable to print at all</LI>
</OL>
The scope of the problem should also be determined as:
<OL>
<LI>
Specific to a machine</LI>

<LI>
Specific to an operating system</LI>

<LI>
Applies to all machines and operating systems</LI>
</OL>

<H2>
Identification</H2>
Once the level and scope of the trouble report is determined the software
sub-system(s) involved with the problem are determined. This may involve
additional communication with the user or vendor to isolate the problem
to a specific cause.

<P>When the sub-system(s) involved have been identified, an engineer will
then determine the change(s) needed and estimate the time required for
the change(s).
<H2>
Correction</H2>
Corrections are scheduled based upon the severity and complexity of the
problem. Once all changes have been made, documented, and tested successfully
a new software release snapshot is generated. Additional tests are added
as necessary for proper testing of the changes.
<H2>
Notification</H2>
The user or vendor is notified when the fix is available or if the problem
was caused by user error.
<H1>
Software Releases</H1>

<H2>
Version Numbering</H2>
CUPS uses a three-part version number separated by periods to represent
the major, minor, and patch release numbers:
<UL>
<PRE>major.minor.patch
1.0.0</PRE>
</UL>
Beta-test releases are indentified by appending the letter B followed by
the build number:
<UL>
<PRE>major.minor.patchbbuild
1.0.0b1</PRE>
</UL>
A CVS snapshot is generated for every beta and final release and uses the
version number with the decimal points replaced by underscores:
<UL>
<PRE>1_0_0b1
1_0_0</PRE>
</UL>
Each change that corrects a fault in a software sub-system increments the
patch release number. If a change affects the software design of CUPS then
the minor release number will be incremented and the patch release number
reset to 0. If CUPS is completely redesigned the major release number will
be incremented and the minor and patch release numbers reset to 0:
<UL>
<PRE>1.0.0b1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First beta release
1.0.0b2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second beta release
1.0.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First production release
1.0.1b1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First beta of 1.0.1
1.0.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Production release of 1.0.1
1.1.0b1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First beta of 1.1.0
1.1.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Production release of 1.1.0
2.0.0b1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First beta of 2.0.0
2.0.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Production release of 2.0.0</PRE>
</UL>

<H2>
Generation</H2>
Software releases shall be generated for each successfully completed software
trouble report. All object and executable files shall be deleted prior
to performing a full build to ensure that source files are recompiled.
<H2>
Testing</H2>
Software testing shall be conducted according to the CUPS Software Test
Plan, CUPS-STP-1.0. Failed tests cause STRs to be generated to correct
the problems found.
<H2>
Release</H2>
When testing has been completed successfully a new distribution image is
created from the current CVS code "snapshot". No production release shall
contain software that has not passed the appropriate software tests.

<H1>
Coding Requirements</H1>
These coding requirements provide detailed information on source file formatting
and documentation content. These guidelines shall be applied to all C source
files provided with CUPS.
<H2>
Source Files</H2>

<H3>
Source File Naming</H3>
All source files names shall be 16 characters or less in length to ensure
compatibility with older UNIX filesystems. Source files containing functions
shall have an extension of ".c". All other source files shall have an extension
of ".h".
<H3>
Source File Documentation</H3>
The top of each source file shall contain a header giving the name of the
file, the purpose or nature of the source file, functions contained in
the file, and a revision history of the file. The file name and revision
information is provided by the CVS "$Id$" and "$Log$
information is provided by the CVS "$Id$" and "Revision 1.1  1998/10/15 18:55:09  mike
information is provided by the CVS "$Id$" and "Initial revision
information is provided by the CVS "$Id$" and "" tags:
<UL>
<PRE>/*
&nbsp;* "$Id$"
&nbsp;*
&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; Description of file contents.
&nbsp;*
&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright 1997-1998 Easy Software Products, All Rights Reserved.
&nbsp;*
&nbsp;* Contents:
&nbsp;*
&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; function1() - Description 1.
&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; function2() - Description 2.
&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; function3() - Description 3.
&nbsp;*
&nbsp;* Revision History:
&nbsp;*
&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; $Log$
&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; Revision 1.1  1998/10/15 18:55:09  mike
&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; Initial revision
&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;*/</PRE>
</UL>
The bottom of each source file shall contain a trailer giving the name
of the file using the CVS "$Id$" tag. The primary purpose of this is to
mark the end of a source file; if the trailer is missing it is possible
that code has been lost near the end of the file:
<UL>
<PRE>/*
&nbsp;* End of "$Id$".
&nbsp;*/</PRE>
</UL>

<H2>
Functions</H2>

<H3>
Function Naming</H3>
Functions with a global scope shall be capitalized ("DoThis", "DoThat",
"DoSomethingElse", etc.) The only exception to this rule shall be the CUPS
interface library functions which must begin with the prefix "cups" ("cupsDoThis",
"cupsDoThat", etc.)

<P>Functions with a local scope shall be declared "static" and be lowercase
with underscores between words ("do_this", "do_that", "do_something_else",
etc.)
<H3>
Function Documentation</H3>
Each function shall begin with a comment header describing what the function
does, the possible input limits (if any), and the possible output values
(if any), and any special information needed:
<UL>
<PRE>/*
&nbsp;* 'do_this()' - Compute y = this(x).
&nbsp;*
&nbsp;* Notes: none.
&nbsp;*/

float&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* O - Inverse power value, 0.0 &lt;= y &lt;= 1.0 */
do_this(float x) /* I - Power value (0.0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1.0) */
{
&nbsp;...
&nbsp;return (y);
}</PRE>
</UL>

<H2>
Variables</H2>

<H3>
Variable Naming</H3>
Variables with a global scope shall be capitalized ("ThisVariable", "ThatVariable",
"ThisStateVariable", etc.) The only exception to this rule shall be the
CUPS interface library global variables which must begin with the prefix
"cups" ("cupsThisVariable", "cupsThatVariable", etc.) Global variables
shall be replaced by function arguments whenever possible.

<P>Variables with a local scope shall be lowercase with underscores between
words ("this_variable", "that_variable", etc.) Any local variables shared
by functions within a source file shall be declared "static".
<H3>
Variable Documentation</H3>
Each variable shall be declared on a separate line and shall be immediately
followed by a comment block describing the variable:
<UL>
<PRE>int this_variable;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* The current state of this */
int that_variable;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* The current state of that */</PRE>
</UL>

<H2>
Types</H2>

<H3>
Type Naming</H3>
All type names shall be lowercase with underscores between words and "_t"
appended to the end of the name ("this_type_t", "that_type_t", etc.) Types
defined for the CUPS interface library must begin with the prefix "cups_"
("cups_this_type_t", etc.)
<H3>
Type Documentation</H3>
Each type shall have a comment block immediately before the typedef:
<UL>
<PRE>/*
&nbsp;* This type for CUPS foobar options.
&nbsp;*/
typedef int cups_this_type_t;</PRE>
</UL>

<H2>
Structures</H2>

<H3>
Structure Naming</H3>
All structure names shall be lowercase with underscores between words and
"_str" appended to the end of the name ("this_struct_str", "that_struct_str",
etc.) Types defined for the CUPS interface library must begin with the
prefix "cups_" ("cups_this_struct_str", etc.)

<P>Structure member names shall be lowercase with underscores between words
("this_member", "that_member", etc.)
<H3>
Structure Documentation</H3>
Each structure shall have a comment block immediately before the struct
and each member shall be documented in accordance with the variable naming
policy above:
<UL>
<PRE>/*
&nbsp;* This structure for CUPS foobar options.
&nbsp;*/
struct cups_this_struct_str
{
&nbsp; int this_member;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* Current state for this */
&nbsp; int that_member;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* Current state for that */
};</PRE>
</UL>

<H2>
Constants</H2>

<H3>
Constant Naming</H3>
All constant names shall be uppercase with underscored between words ("THIS_CONSTANT",
"THAT_CONSTANT", etc.) Constants defined for the CUPS interface library
must begin with the prefix "CUPS_" ("CUPS_THIS_CONSTANT", "CUPS_THAT_CONSTANT",
etc.)

<P>Typed enumerations shall be used for all constants to allow for type
checking by the compiler.
<H3>
Constant Documentation</H3>
Comment blocks shall immediately follow each constant:
<UL>
<PRE>enum
{
&nbsp; CUPS_THIS_TRAY,&nbsp;&nbsp; /* This tray */
&nbsp; CUPS_THAT_TRAY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* That tray */
};</PRE>
</UL>

<H2>
Code</H2>

<H3>
Code Documentation</H3>
All source code shall utilize block comments within functions to describe
the operations being performed by a group of statements:
<UL>
<PRE>/*
&nbsp;* Clear the state array before we begin...
&nbsp;*/

for (i = 0; i &lt; (sizeof(array) / sizeof(sizeof(array[0])); i ++)
&nbsp; array[i] = STATE_IDLE;

/*
&nbsp;* Wait for state changes...
&nbsp;*/

do
{
&nbsp; for (i = 0; i &lt; (sizeof(array) / sizeof(sizeof(array[0])); i ++)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (array[i] != STATE_IDLE)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; break;

&nbsp; if (i == (sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0])))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sleep(1);
} while (i == (sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0])));</PRE>
</UL>

<H3>
Code Style</H3>

<H4 TYPE="a">
Indentation</H4>
All code blocks enclosed by brackets shall begin with the opening brace
on a new line. The code then follows starting on a new line after the brace
and is indented 2 spaces. The closing brace is then placed on a new line
following the code at the original indentation:
<UL>
<PRE>{
&nbsp; int i; /* Looping var */

&nbsp;/*
&nbsp; * Process foobar values from 0 to 999...
&nbsp; */

&nbsp; for (i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i ++)
&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do_this(i);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do_that(i);
&nbsp; }
}</PRE>
</UL>
Single-line statements following "do", "else", "for", "if", and "while"
shall be indented 2 spaces as well. Blocks of code in a "switch" block
shall be indented 4 spaces after each "case" and "default" case:
<UL>
<PRE>switch (array[i])
{
&nbsp; case STATE_IDLE :
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do_this(i);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do_that(i);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; break;
&nbsp; default :
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do_nothing(i);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; break;
}</PRE>
</UL>

<H4>
Spacing</H4>
A space shall follow each reserved word ("if", "while", etc.) Spaces shall
not be inserted between a function name and the arguments in parenthesis.
<H4>
Return Values</H4>
Parenthesis shall surround values returned from a function using "return":
<UL>
<PRE>return (STATE_IDLE);</PRE>
</UL>

<H4>
Loops</H4>
Whenever convenient loops should count downward to zero to improve program
performance:
<UL>
<PRE>for (i = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]) - 1; i >= 0; i --)
&nbsp; array[i] = STATE_IDLE;</PRE>
</UL>
