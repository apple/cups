<H1>Scope</H1>

<H2>Identification</H2>

This software version description document provides release information for the
Common UNIX Printing System ("CUPS") Version 1.1.

<H2>System Overview</H2>

The Common UNIX Printing System provides a portable printing layer for 
UNIX&reg; operating systems. It has been developed by Easy Software 
Products to promote a standard printing solution for all UNIX vendors 
and users. CUPS provides the System V and Berkeley command-line interfaces.

<P>CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol (IETF-IPP) as the basis
for managing print jobs and queues. The Line Printer Daemon (LPD,
RFC1179), Server Message Block (SMB), and AppSocket protocols are also
supported with reduced functionality.

<P>CUPS adds network printer browsing and PostScript Printer
Description (&quot;PPD&quot;)-based printing options to support real
world applications under UNIX.

<P>CUPS also includes a customized version of GNU GhostScript
(currently based off GNU GhostScript 4.03) and an image file RIP that
can be used to support non-PostScript printers.
