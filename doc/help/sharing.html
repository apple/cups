<H1 CLASS="title">Printer Sharing</H1>

<p>This document discusses several ways to configure printer sharing.</p>

<h2><a name="BASICS">The Basics</h2>

<p>A "server" is any machine that communicates directly to a printer. A "client" is any machine that sends print jobs to a server for final printing. Clients can also be servers if they communicate directly with any printers of their own.</p>

<p>By default, CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) to send jobs from a client to a server. When printing to legacy print servers you may also use the Line Printer Daemon (LPD) protocol when printing to older UNIX-based servers or Server Message Block (SMB) when printing to Windows<sup>&reg;</sup> servers.</p>

<p>Clients can automatically discover and access shared printers via DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD a.k.a. Bonjour<sup>&reg;</sup>). SMB browsing can also be used to manually discover and access shared printers when <a href="http://www.samba.org/">Samba</a> is installed.</p>


<h2><a name="SERVER_CONFIG">Configuring the Server</a></h2>

<p>You must enable printer sharing on the server before clients can print through it. The simplest way to do this is to use the <a href="man-cupsctl.html">cupsctl(8)</a> command on the server:</p>

<pre class="command">
cupsctl --share-printers
</pre>

<p>By default, the above command will allow printing from other clients on the same subnet as your server. To allow printing from any subnet, use the following command instead:</p>

<pre class="command">
cupsctl --share-printers --remote-any
</pre>

<p>Next, tag each printer that you want to share using the <a href="man-lpadmin.html">lpadmin(8)</a> command on the server, for example:</p>

<pre class="command">
lpadmin -p printer -o printer-is-shared=true
</pre>

<p>You can require authentication for shared printing by setting the policy on each printer, for example:</p>

<pre class="command">
lpadmin -p printer -o printer-op-policy=authenticated
</pre>


<h2><a name="AUTO_IPP">Automatic Configuration using IPP</a></h2>

<blockquote><b>Note:</b>
<p>This method of configuration does not work on OS X 10.7 or later because sandboxed applications do not always have direct network access.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CUPS can be configured to run without a local spooler and send all jobs to a
single server. However, if that server goes down then all printing will be
disabled. Use this configuration only as absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>The default server is normally the local system ("localhost"). To override
the default server create a file named <var>/etc/cups/client.conf</var> with a
line as follows:</p>

<pre class='example'>
ServerName <em>server</em>
</pre>

<p>The <var>server</var> name can be the hostname or IP address of the default
server. If the server is not using the default IPP port (631), you can add the
port number at the end like this:</p>

<pre class='example'>
ServerName <em>server:port</em>
</pre>

<p>The default server can also be customized on a per-user basis. To set a
user-specific server create a file named <var>~/.cups/client.conf</var> instead.
The user <var>client.conf</var> file takes precedence over the system one.</p>

<p>Finally, you can set the <code>CUPS_SERVER</code> environment variable to
override the default server for a single process, for example:</p>

<pre class='command'>
CUPS_SERVER=server:port firefox http://www.cups.org
</pre>

<p>will run the Firefox web browser pointed to the specified server and
port. The environment variable overrides both the user and system
<var>client.conf</var> files, if any.</p>


<h2><a name="MANUAL">Manual Configuration of Print Queues</a></h2>

<blockquote><b>Note:</b>
<p>This method of configuration does not work on OS X 10.7 or later because sandboxed applications do not always have direct network access.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most tedious method of configuring client machines is to configure
each remote queue by hand using the <a href="man-lpadmin.html">lpadmin(8)</a>
command:</p>

<pre class='command'>
lpadmin -p <em>printer</em> -E -v ipp://<em>server</em>/printers/<em>printer</em>
</pre>

<p>The <var>printer</var> name is the name of the printer on the server machine.
The <var>server</var> name is the hostname or IP address of the server machine.
Repeat the <b>lpadmin</b> command for each remote printer you wish to use.</p>
