<P>The <VAR>access_log</VAR> file lists each HTTP resource that
is accessed by a web browser or client. Each line is in an
extended version of the so-called "Common Log Format" used by
many web servers and web reporting tools:</P>

<P CLASS="command">

<P>The <I>host</I> field will normally only be an IP address
unless you have enabled the <A
HREF="cupsd-conf-reference.html#HostNameLookups"><CODE>HostNameLookups</CODE></A>
directive in the <VAR>cupsd.conf</VAR> file or if the IP address
corresponds to your local machine.</P>

<P>The <I>group</I> field always contains "-".</P>

<P>The <I>user</I> field is the authenticated username of the
requesting user. If no username and password is supplied for the
request then this field contains "-".</P>

<P>The <I>date-time</I> field is the date and time of the request
in local time and is in the format:</P>

<P CLASS="command">
[DD/MON/YYYY:HH:MM:SS +ZZZZ]
</P>

<P>The <I>method</I> field is the HTTP method used: "GET",
"OPTIONS", "PUT", or "POST". "GET" requests are used to get files
from the server, both for the web interface and to get
configuration and log files. "OPTIONS" requests are used to
upgrade connections to TLS encryption. "PUT" requests are used to
upload configuration files. "POST" requests are used for web
interface forms and IPP requests.</P>

<P>The <I>resource</I> field is the filename of the requested
resource.</P>

<P>The <I>version</I> field is the HTTP specification version used by the
client. For CUPS clients this will always be "HTTP/1.1".</P>

<P>The <I>status</I> field contains the HTTP result status of the
request, as follows:</P>

<UL>

	<LI><CODE>200</CODE> - Successful operation.</LI>

	<LI><CODE>201</CODE> - File created/modified successfully.</LI>

	<LI><CODE>304</CODE> - The requested file has not changed.</LI>

	<LI><CODE>400</CODE> - Bad HTTP request; typically this
	means that you have a malicious program trying to access
	your server.</LI>

	<LI><CODE>401</CODE> - Unauthorized, authentication
	(username + password) is required.</LI>

	<LI><CODE>403</CODE> - Access is forbidden; typically
	this means that a client tried to access a file or
	resource they do not have permission to access.</LI>

	<LI><CODE>404</CODE> - The file or resource does not
	exist.</LI>

	<LI><CODE>405</CODE> - URL access method is not allowed;
	typically this means you have a web browser using your
	server as a proxy.</LI>

	<LI><CODE>413</CODE> - Request too large; typically this
	means that a client tried to print a file larger than the
	<A
	HREF="cupsd-conf-reference.html#MaxRequestSize"><CODE>MaxRequestSize</CODE></A>
	allows.</LI>

	<LI><CODE>426</CODE> - Upgrading to TLS-encrypted
	connection.</LI>

	<LI><CODE>500</CODE> - Server error; typically this
	happens when the server is unable to open/create a file -
	consult the <VAR>error_log</VAR> file for details.</LI>

	<LI><CODE>501</CODE> - The client requested encryption
	but encryption support is not enabled/compiled in.</LI>

	<LI><CODE>505</CODE> - HTTP version number not supported;
	typically this means that you have a malicious program
	trying to access your server.</LI>

</UL>

<P>The <I>bytes</I> field contains the number of bytes in the
request. For POST requests the <I>bytes</I> field contains the
number of bytes of non-IPP data that is received from the
client.</P>

<P>The <I>ipp-operation</I> field contains either "-" for non-IPP
requests or the IPP operation name for POST requests containing
an IPP request.</P>

<P>The <I>ipp-status</I> field contains either "-" for non-IPP
requests or the IPP status code name for POST requests containing
an IPP response.</P>
