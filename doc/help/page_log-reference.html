<P>The <VAR>page_log</VAR> file lists each page that is sent to a printer.
Each line contains the following information:

<UL><PRE>
printer user job-id date-time page-number num-copies job-billing

DeskJet root 2 [20/May/1999:19:21:05 +0000] 1 0 acme-123
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <I>printer</I> field contains the name of the printer that
printed the page. If you send a job to a printer class, this field will
contain the name of the printer that was assigned the job.

<P>The <I>user</I> field contains the name of the user (the IPP
<CODE>requesting-user-name</CODE> attribute) that submitted this file for
printing.

<P>The <I>job-id</I> field contains the job number of the page being printed.
Job numbers are reset to 1 whenever the ESP Print Pro server is started, so don't depend
on this number being unique!

<P>The <I>date-time</I> field contains the date and time of when the page
started printing. The format of this field is identical to the <I>data-time</I>
field in the <VAR>access_log</VAR> file.

<P>The <I>page-number</I> and <I>num-pages</I> fields contain the page number
and number of copies being printed of that page. For printer that can not
produce copies on their own, the <I>num-pages</I> field will always be 1.

<P>The <I>job-billing</I> field contains a copy of the
<CODE>job-billing</CODE> attribute provided with the IPP
<CODE>create-job</CODE> or <CODE>print-job</CODE> requests or "-" if none
was provided.
