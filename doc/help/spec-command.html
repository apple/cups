<h2 class='title'><a name='INTRODUCTION'>Introduction</a></h2>

<p>This specification describes the CUPS command file format
(application/vnd.cups-command) which is used to send printer
maintenance commands to a printer in a device-independent way.
The current specification supports basic maintenance functions
such as head cleaning and self-test pages.</p>

<p>Printer drivers advertise support for the CUPS command file
format by providing a filter for the
<var>application/vnd.cups-command</var> file type. Applications
can determine if a printer supports printing of CUPS command
files by checking the <code>printer-type</code> attribute for the
<code>CUPS_PRINTER_COMMANDS</code> capability bit.</p>

<h2 class='title'><a name='SYNTAX'>File Syntax</a></h2>

<p>CUPS command files are ASCII text files.  The first line of a
CUPS command file MUST contain:</p>

<pre class='command'>
#CUPS-COMMAND
</pre>

<p>After that, each line is either a command or a comment.
Comments begin with the # character, e.g.:</p>

<pre class='command'>
# This is a comment
</pre>

<p>The printer commands are described below. Printer commands are
case-insensitive, so "PRINTSELFTESTPAGE", "printselftestpage",
and "PrintSelfTestPage" are equivalent. Commands that accept
arguments have their arguments on the same line separated by
whitespace.</p>

<h2 class='title'><a name='COMMANDS'>Commands</a></h2>

<h3>Clean</h3>

<p class='summary'>Clean colorname</p>

<p>Does a standard print head cleaning.  If a printer does not
support cleaning of individual colors or cartridges, then all
print heads are cleaned. Command filters MUST support the "all"
colorname. Other standard color names include "black", "color",
"photo", "cyan", "magenta", "yellow", "light-cyan",
"light-magenta", "light-black", "light-gray", and
"dark-gray".</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre class='command'>
#CUPS-COMMAND
Clean all
</pre>

<h3>PrintSelfTestPage</h3>

<p class='summary'>PrintSelfTestPage</p>

<p>Print a self-test page on the printer. Typically this page
shows if all jets on a print head are functioning properly.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre class='command'>
#CUPS-COMMAND
PrintSelfTestPage
</pre>

</body>
</html>
