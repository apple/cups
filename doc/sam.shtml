<H1 ALIGN="RIGHT"><A NAME="BUILDING_INSTALLING">2 - Building and Installing CUPS</A></H1>

<P>This chapter shows how to build and install the Common UNIX Printing System.
If you are installing a binary distribution from the CUPS web site, proceed to
the section titled, <A HREF="#BINARY">Installing a Binary Distribution</A>.

<H2>Installing a Source Distribution</H2>

<P>This section describes how to compile and install CUPS on your system
from the source code.

<H3><A NAME="REQUIREMENTS">Requirements</A></H3>

<P>You'll need ANSI-compliant C and C++ compilers to build CUPS on your
system. As its name implies, CUPS is designed to run on the UNIX
operating system, however the CUPS interface library and most of the
filters and backends supplied with CUPS should also compile and run
under Microsoft Windows.

<P>For the image file filters and PostScript RIP, you'll need the JPEG,
PNG, TIFF, and ZLIB libraries. CUPS will build without these, but with
significantly reduced functionality. Easy Software Products maintains a
mirror of the current versions of these libraries at:

<UL><PRE>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.easysw.com/pub/libraries">ftp://ftp.easysw.com/pub/libraries</A>
</PRE></UL>

<P>If you make changes to the man pages you'll need GNU groff or another
nroff-like package. GNU groff is available from:

<UL><PRE>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/groff">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/groff</A>
</PRE></UL>

<P>The documentation is formatted using the HTMLDOC software. If you need to
make changes you can get the HTMLDOC software from:

<UL><PRE>
<A HREF="http://www.easysw.com/htmldoc">http://www.easysw.com/htmldoc</A>
</PRE></UL>

<P>Finally, you'll need a <CODE>make</CODE> program that
understands the <CODE>include</CODE> directive - FreeBSD,
NetBSD, and OpenBSD developers should use the <CODE>gmake</CODE>
program.

<H3><A NAME="COMPILING">Compiling CUPS</A></H3>

<P>CUPS uses GNU autoconf to configure the makefiles and source code
for your system. Type the following command to configure CUPS for your
system:

<UL><PRE>
<B>./configure ENTER</B>
</PRE></UL>

<P>The default installation will put the CUPS software in the
<VAR>/etc</VAR>, <VAR>/usr</VAR>, and <VAR>/var</VAR> directories on
your system, which will overwrite any existing printing commands on
your system. Use the <CODE>--prefix</CODE> option to install the CUPS
software in another location:

<UL><PRE>
<B>./configure --prefix=/some/directory ENTER</B>
</PRE></UL>

<P>If the PNG, JPEG, TIFF, and ZLIB libraries are not installed in a
system default location (typically <VAR>/usr/include</VAR> and
<VAR>/usr/lib</VAR>) you'll need to set the <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE>,
<CODE>CXXFLAGS</CODE>, and <CODE>LDFLAGS</CODE> environment variables
prior to running configure:

<UL><PRE>
<B>setenv CFLAGS "-I/some/directory" ENTER</B>
<B>setenv CXXFLAGS "-I/some/directory" ENTER</B>
<B>setenv LDFLAGS "-L/some/directory" ENTER</B>
<B>setenv DSOFLAGS "-L/some/directory" ENTER</B>
<B>./configure ... ENTER</B>
</PRE></UL>

<P>or:

<UL><PRE>
<B>CFLAGS="-I/some/directory"; export CFLAGS ENTER</B>
<B>CXXFLAGS="-I/some/directory"; export CXXFLAGS ENTER</B>
<B>LDFLAGS="-L/some/directory"; export LDFLAGS ENTER</B>
<B>DSOFLAGS="-L/some/directory"; export DSOFLAGS ENTER</B>
<B>./configure ... ENTER</B>
</PRE></UL>

<P>To enable support for encryption, you'll also want to add the
"--enable-ssl" option:

<UL><PRE>
./configure --enable-ssl
</PRE></UL>

<P>SSL and TLS support require the OpenSSL library, available at:

<UL><PRE>
<A HREF="http://www.openssl.org">http://www.openssl.org</A>
</PRE></UL>

<P>If the OpenSSL headers and libraries are not installed in the
standard directories, use the <CODE>--with-openssl-includes</CODE>
and <CODE>--with-openssl-libs</CODE> options:</P>

<UL><PRE>
./configure --enable-ssl \
    --with-openssl-includes=/foo/bar/include \
    --with-openssl-libs=/foo/bar/lib
</PRE></UL>

<P>Once you have configured things, just type:

<UL><PRE>
<B>make ENTER</B>
</PRE></UL>

<P>to build the software.

<H1 ALIGN="RIGHT"><A NAME="MANAGING_PRINTERS">3 - Managing Printers</A></H1>

<P>This chapter describes how to add your first printer and how to
manage your printers.

<H2>The Basics</H2>

<P>Each printer queue has a name associated with it; the printer name
must start with a letter and can contain up to 127 letters, numbers,
and the underscore (_). Case is not significant, e.g. "PRINTER", "Printer",
and "printer" are considered to be the same name.

<P>Printer queues also have a device associated with them. The device can be
a parallel port, a network interface, and so forth. Devices within CUPS use
Uniform Resource Identifiers ("URIs") which are a more general form of
Uniform Resource Locators ("URLs") that are used in your web browser. For
example, the first parallel port in Linux usually uses a device URI of
<CODE>parallel:/dev/lp1</CODE>.

<!-- NEED 2.5in -->
<P>You can see a complete list of supported devices by running the
<CODE>lpinfo(8)</CODE> command:

<UL><PRE>
<B>lpinfo -v ENTER</B>
network socket
network http
network ipp
network lpd
direct parallel:/dev/lp1
serial serial:/dev/ttyS1?baud=115200
serial serial:/dev/ttyS2?baud=115200
direct usb:/dev/usb/lp0
network smb
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <CODE>-v</CODE> option specifies that you want a list of available
devices. The first word in each line is the type of device (direct, file,
network, or serial) and is followed by the device URI or method name for
that device. File devices have device URIs of the form
<CODE>file:/directory/filename</CODE> while network devices use the more
familiar <CODE>method://server</CODE> or <CODE>method://server/path</CODE>
format.

<P>Finally, printer queues usually have a PostScript Printer Description
("PPD") file associated with them. PPD files describe the capabilities of
each printer, the page sizes supported, etc., and are used for PostScript
and non-PostScript printers. CUPS includes PPD files for HP LaserJet, HP
DeskJet, EPSON 9-pin, EPSON 24-pin, and EPSON Stylus printers.

<H2>Adding Your First Printer</H2>

<P>CUPS provides two methods for adding printers: a command-line
program called <CODE>lpadmin(8)</CODE> and a Web interface. The
<CODE>lpadmin</CODE> command allows you to perform most printer
administration tasks from the command-line and is located in
<VAR>/usr/sbin</VAR>. The Web interface is located at:

<UL><PRE>
<A HREF="http://localhost:631/admin">http://localhost:631/admin</A>
</PRE></UL>

<P>and steps you through printer configuration. If you don't like
command-line interfaces, try the <A HREF="#ADD_WEB">Web interface</A> instead.

<H3>Adding Your First Printer from the Command-Line</H3>

<P>Run the <CODE>lpadmin</CODE> command with the <CODE>-p</CODE> option to add a
printer to CUPS:

<UL><PRE>
<B>/usr/sbin/lpadmin -p <I>printer</I> -E -v <I>device</I> -m <I>ppd</I> ENTER</B>
</PRE></UL>

<P>For a HP DeskJet printer connected to the parallel port this would look
like:

<UL><PRE>
<B>/usr/sbin/lpadmin -p DeskJet -E -v parallel:/dev/lp1 -m deskjet.ppd ENTER</B>
</PRE></UL>

<P>Similarly, a HP LaserJet printer using a JetDirect network interface at
IP address 11.22.33.44 would be added with the command:

<UL><PRE>
<B>/usr/sbin/lpadmin -p LaserJet -E -v socket://11.22.33.44 -m laserjet.ppd ENTER</B>
</PRE></UL>

<P>As you can see, <CODE>deskjet.ppd</CODE> and <CODE>laserjet.ppd</CODE> are
the PPD files for the HP DeskJet and HP LaserJet drivers included with CUPS.
You'll find a complete list of PPD files and the printers they will work with
in <A HREF="#PRINTER_DRIVERS">Appendix C, "Printer Drivers"</A>.


<P>For a dot matrix printer connected to the serial port this would might look like:

<UL><PRE>
<B>/usr/sbin/lpadmin -p DotMatrix -E -v serial:/dev/ttyS0?baud=9600+size=8+parity=none+flow=soft deskjet.ppd ENTER</B>
</PRE></UL>

<P>Here you specify the serial port (e.g. S0,S1, d0, d1), baud rate 
(e.g. 9600, 19200, 38400, 115200, etc.), number of bits, parity, and flow control.
If you do not need flow control, delete the "+flow=soft" portion.


<H3><A NAME="ADD_WEB">Adding Your First Printer from the Web</A></H3>

<P>The CUPS web server provides a user-friendly "wizard" interface for
adding your printers. Rather than figuring out which device URI and PPD file
to use, you can instead click on the appropriate listings and fill in some
simple information. Enter the following URL in your web browser to begin:

<UL><PRE>
<A HREF="http://localhost:631/admin">http://localhost:631/admin</A>
</PRE></UL>

<P>Click on the <VAR>Add Printer</VAR> button to add a printer.

<H2>Managing Printers from the Command-Line</H2>

<P>The <CODE>lpadmin</CODE> command enables you to perform most printer
administration tasks from the command-line. You'll find <CODE>lpadmin</CODE>
in the <VAR>/usr/sbin</VAR> directory.

<H3>Adding and Modifying Printers</H3>

<P>Run the <CODE>lpadmin</CODE> command with the <CODE>-p</CODE> option
to add or modify a printer:

<UL><PRE>
<B>/usr/sbin/lpadmin -p <I>printer</I> <I>options</I> ENTER</B>
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <I>options</I> arguments can be any of the following:

<UL>
<DL>

	<DT>-c <I>class</I>

	<DD>Adds the named printer to printer class <VAR>class</VAR>.
	If the class does not exist then it is created.

	<DT>-i <I>interface</I>

	<DD>Copies the named <VAR>interface</VAR> script to the printer.
	Interface scripts are used by System V printer drivers. Since
	all filtering is disabled when using an interface script, scripts
	generally should not be used unless there is no other driver for
	a printer.

	<DT>-m <I>model</I>

	<DD>Specifies a standard printer driver which is usually a PPD
	file. A list of all available models can be displayed using the
	<CODE>lpinfo</CODE> command with the <CODE>-m</CODE> option. A
	list of printer drivers included with CUPS can be found in
	<A HREF="#PRINTER_DRIVERS">Appendix C, "Printer Drivers"</A>.

	<DT>-r <I>class</I>

	<DD>Removes the named printer from printer class <VAR>class</VAR>.
	If the resulting class becomes empty then it is removed.

	<DT>-v <I>device-uri</I>

	<DD>Sets the device for communicating with the printer. If a
	job is currently printing on the named printer then the job
	will be restarted and sent to the new device.

	<DT>-D <I>info</I>

	<DD>Provides a textual description of the printer, e.g.
	"John's Personal Printer".

	<DT>-E

	<DD>Enables the printer and accepts job. This option is
	equivalent to running the <CODE>enable(1)</CODE> and
	<CODE>accept(8)</CODE> commands on the printer.

	<DT>-L <I>location</I>

	<DD>Provides a textual location for the printer, e.g.
	"Computer Lab 5".

	<DT>-P <I>ppd-file</I>

	<DD>Specifies a local PPD file for the printer driver.

</DL>
</UL>

<H3>Deleting Printers</H3>

<P>Run the <CODE>lpadmin</CODE> command with the <CODE>-x</CODE> option
to delete a printer:

<UL><PRE>
<B>/usr/sbin/lpadmin -x <I>printer</I> ENTER</B>
</PRE></UL>

<H3>Setting the Default Printer</H3>

<P>Run the <CODE>lpadmin</CODE> command with the <CODE>-d</CODE> option
to set a default printer:

<UL><PRE>
<B>/usr/sbin/lpadmin -d <I>printer</I> ENTER</B>
</PRE></UL>

<P>The default printer can be overridden by the user using the
<CODE>lpoptions(1)</CODE> command.

<H3>Starting and Stopping Printers</H3>

<P>The <CODE>enable</CODE> and <CODE>disable</CODE> commands start and stop
printer queues, respectively:

<UL><PRE>
<B>/usr/bin/enable <I>printer</I> ENTER</B>
<B>/usr/bin/disable <I>printer</I> ENTER</B>
</PRE></UL>

<P>Printers that are disabled may still accept jobs for printing, but won't
actually print any files until they are restarted. This is useful if the
printer malfunctions and you need time to correct the problem. Any queued
jobs are printed after the printer is enabled (started).

<H3>Accepting and Rejecting Print Jobs</H3>

<P>The <CODE>accept</CODE> and <CODE>reject</CODE> commands accept and reject
print jobs for the named printer, respectively:

<UL><PRE>
<B>/usr/sbin/accept <I>printer</I> ENTER</B>
<B>/usr/sbin/reject <I>printer</I> ENTER</B>
</PRE></UL>

<P>As noted above, a printer can be stopped but accepting new print
jobs. A printer can also be rejecting new print jobs while it finishes
those that have been queued. This is useful for when you must perform
maintenance on the printer and will not have it available to users for
a long period of time.

<H3>Setting Quotas on a Printer</H3>

<P>CUPS supports page and size-based quotas for each printer.
The quotas are tracked individually for each user, but a single set of
limits applies to all users for a partiuclar printer. For example, you
can limit every user to 5 pages per day on an expensive printer, but
you cannot limit every user except Johnny.</P>

<P>The <I>job-k-limit</I>, <I>job-page-limit</I>, and <I>job-quota-peiod</I>
options determine whether and how quotas are enforced for a printer.
The <I>job-quota-period</I> option determines the time interval for
quota tracking. The interval is expressed in seconds, so a day is
86,400, a week is 604,800 and a month is 2,592,000 seconds. The
<I>job-k-limit</I> option specifies the job size limit in killobytes. The 
<I>job-page-limit</I> option specifies the number of pages limit.</P>

<P>For quotas to be enforced, the period and at least one of the limits
must be set to a non-zero value. The following options will enable
quotas:</P>

<UL>
<PRE>
<B>/usr/sbin/lpadmin -p <I>printer</I> -o job-quota-period=604800 -o job-k-limit=1024 <I>ENTER</I></B>
<B>/usr/sbin/lpadmin -p <I>printer</I> -o job-quota-period=604800 -o job-page-limit=100 <I>ENTER</I></B>
</PRE>
</UL>

<P>Or, you can combine all three options on the same line.</P>

<H3>Restricting User Access to a Printer</H3>

<P>The <CODE>-u</CODE> option of the <CODE>lpadmin</CODE> command controls which users can
print to a printer. The default configuration allows all users to print
to a printer:</P>

<UL>
<PRE>
<B>/usr/sbin/lpadmin -p <I>printer</I> -u allow:all <I>ENTER</I></B>
</PRE>
</UL>

<P>CUPS supports allow and deny lists so that you can specify a
list of users who are allowed to print or not allowed to print. Along
with your list of users, you can specify whether they are allowed or
not allowed to use the printer:</P>

<UL>
<PRE>
<B>/usr/sbin/lpadmin -p <I>printer</I> -u allow:peter,paul,mary <I>ENTER</I></B>
</PRE>
</UL>

<P>This command allows peter, paul, and mary to print to the named
printer, but all other users cannot print. The command:</P>

<UL>
<PRE>
<B>/usr/sbin/lpadmin -p <I>printer</I> -u deny:peter,paul,mary <I>ENTER</I></B>
</PRE>
</UL>

<P>has the opposite effect. All users except peter, paul, and mary will
be able to print to the named printer.</P>

<CENTER>
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#cccccc" BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="5" WIDTH="80%">
<TR>
	<TD><B>NOTE:</B>

	<P>The <I>allow</I> and <I>deny</I> options are not cummulative. That
	is, you must provide the complete list of users to allow or deny each
	time.</P>

	<P>Also, CUPS only maintains one list of users - the list can
	allow or deny users from printing. If you specify an allow list and
	then specify a deny list, the deny list will replace the allow list -
	only one list is active at any time.</P>

	</TD>

<H2>Managing Printers from the Web</H2>

<P>The Web interface is located at:

<UL><PRE>
<A HREF="http://localhost:631/admin">http://localhost:631/admin</A>
</PRE></UL>

<P>From there you can perform all printer management tasks with a few
simple mouse clicks.


<H1 ALIGN="RIGHT"><A NAME="PRINTER_CLASSES">4 - Printer Classes</A></H1>

<P>This chapter describes what printer classes are and how to manage them.

<H2>The Basics</H2>

<P>CUPS provides collections of printers called <I>printer classes</I>. Jobs
sent to a class are forwarded to the first available printer in the class.
Classes can themselves be members of other classes, so it is possible for
you to define very large, distributed printer classes for high-availability
printing.

<P>CUPS also supports <I>implicit classes</I>. Implicit classes work just
like printer classes, but they are created automatically based upon the
available printers and classes on the network. This allows you to setup
multiple print servers with identical printer configurations and have the
client machines send their print jobs to the first available server. If
one or more servers go down, the jobs are automatically redirected to the
servers that are running, providing fail-safe printing.

<H2>Managing Printer Classes from the Command-Line</H2>

<P>Run the <CODE>lpadmin</CODE> command with the <CODE>-p</CODE> and <CODE>-c</CODE> options
to add a printer to a class:

<UL><PRE>
<B>/usr/sbin/lpadmin -p <I>printer</I> -c <I>class</I> ENTER</B>
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <I>class</I> is created automatically if it doesn't exist. To remove a
printer from a class use the <CODE>-r</CODE> option:

<UL><PRE>
<B>/usr/sbin/lpadmin -p <I>printer</I> -r <I>class</I> ENTER</B>
</PRE></UL>

<P>To remove the entire class just use the <CODE>-x</CODE> option:

<UL><PRE>
<B>/usr/sbin/lpadmin -x <I>class</I> ENTER</B>
</PRE></UL>

<H2>Managing Printer Classes from the Web Interface</H2>

<P>The Web interface is located at:

<UL><PRE>
<A HREF="http://localhost:631/admin">http://localhost:631/admin</A>
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <VAR>Add Class</VAR> and <VAR>Modify Class</VAR> interfaces provide a
list of available printers; click on the printers of interest to add them to
the class.

<H2>Implicit Classes</H2>

<P>A noted earlier, implicit classes are created automatically from the
available network printers and classes. To disable this functionality,
set the <A HREF="#ImplicitClasses"><CODE>ImplicitClasses</CODE></A>
directive to <CODE>Off</CODE> in the <CODE>cupsd.conf</CODE> file. You
will find more information on doing this in

Management"</A>.


<H1 ALIGN="RIGHT"><A NAME="CLIENT_SETUP">5 - Client Setup</A></H1>

<P>This chapter discusses several ways to configure CUPS clients for
printing.

<H2>The Basics</H2>

<P>A client is any machine that sends print jobs to another machine for
final printing. Clients can also be servers if they communicate directly with
any printers of their own.

<P>CUPS supports several methods of configuring client machines:

<UL>
	<LI><A HREF="#CLIENT_MANUAL">Manual configuration of print queues.</A>
	<LI><A HREF="#CLIENT_SERVER">Specifying a single server for printing.</A>
	<LI><A HREF="#CLIENT_AUTO">Automatic configuration of print queues.</A>
	<LI><A HREF="#CLIENT_POLL">Specifying multiple servers for printing.</A>
	<LI><A HREF="#CLIENT_RELAY">Relaying printers to other clients.</A>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="CLIENT_MANUAL">Manual Configuration of Print Queues</A></H3>

<P>The most tedious method of configuring client machines is to configure
each remote queue by hand using the <CODE>lpadmin</CODE> command:

<UL><PRE>
<B>lpadmin -p <I>printer</I> -E -v ipp://<I>server</I>/printers/<I>printer</I> ENTER</B>
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <CODE>printer</CODE> name is the name of the printer on the server
machine. The <CODE>server</CODE> name is the hostname or IP address of the
server machine. Repeat the <CODE>lpadmin</CODE> command for each remote
printer you wish to use.</P>

<CENTER>
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#cccccc" BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="5" WIDTH="80%">
	<TR>
	<TD><B> NOTE:</B>
	<P>Manual configuration of print queues is not recommended for large
	numbers of client machines because of the administration nightmare it
	creates. For busy networks, consider subnetting groups of clients and
	polling and relaying printer information instead.</P>
	</TD>
	</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>

<H3><A NAME="CLIENT_SERVER">Specifying a Single Server for Printing</A></H3>

<P>CUPS can be configured to run without a local spooler and send all
jobs to a single server. However, if that server goes down then all
printing will be disabled. Use this configuration only as absolutely needed.

<P>The default server is normally "localhost". To override the default
server create a file named <VAR>/etc/cups/client.conf</VAR> and add
a line reading:

<UL><PRE>
ServerName <I>server</I>
</PRE></UL>

<P>to the file. The <VAR>server</VAR> name can be the hostname or IP address
of the default server.

<P>The default server can also be customized on a per-user basis. To set a
user-specific server create a file named <VAR>~/.cupsrc</VAR> and add a line
reading:

<UL><PRE>
ServerName <I>server</I>
</PRE></UL>

<P>to the file. The <VAR>server</VAR> name can be the hostname or IP
address of the default server.

<H3><A NAME="CLIENT_AUTO">Automatic Configuration of Print Queues</A></H3>

<P>CUPS supports automatic client configuration of printers on the same
subnet. To configure printers on the same subnet, <I>do nothing</I>.
Each client should see the available printers within 30 seconds
automatically. The printer and class lists are updated automatically as
printers and servers are added or removed.

<P>If you want to see printers on other subnets as well, use the
<A HREF="#BrowsePoll"><CODE>BrowsePoll</CODE></A> 
directive as described next.</P>

<CENTER>
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#cccccc" BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="5" WIDTH="80%">
	<TR>
	<TD><B> NOTE:</B>
	<P>The<A HREF="#BrowseAddress"> <CODE>BrowseAddress</CODE></A> directive
	enables broadcast traffic from your server. The default configuration
	braodcasts printer information every 30 seconds. Although this printer
	information does not use much bandwidth, typically about 80 bytes per
	printer, it can add up with large numbers of servers and printers.</P>
	<P>Use the <A HREF="#BrowseInterval"><CODE>BrowseInterval</CODE></A> 
	and <A HREF="#BrowseTimeout"><CODE>BrowseTimeout</CODE></A> directives to tune
	the amount of data that is added to your network load. In addition,
	subnets can be used to minimize the amount of traffic that is carried
	by the &quot;backbone&quot; of your large network.</P>
	</TD>
	</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>

<H3><A NAME="CLIENT_POLL">Specifying Multiple Servers for Printing</A></H3>

<P>If you have CUPS servers on different subnets, then you should configure
CUPS to poll those servers. Polling provides the benefits of automatic
configuration without significant configuration on the clients, and multiple
clients on the same subnet can share the same configuration information.

<P>Polling is enabled by specifying one or more 
<A HREF="#BrowsePoll"><CODE>BrowsePoll</CODE></A> 
directives in the <VAR>/etc/cups/cupsd.conf</VAR> file. 
For information on making these changes, see 
<A HREF="#PRINTING_MANAGEMENT">Chapter 6, "Printing System Management"</A>.

<P>Multiple <A HREF="#BrowsePoll"><CODE>BrowsePoll</CODE></A> lines can
be used to poll multiple CUPS servers. To limit the amount of
polling you do from client machines, you can have only one of the
clients do the polling and relay that information to the others on the
same subnet (described next).</P>

<H3><A NAME="CLIENT_RELAY">Relaying Printers to Other Clients</A></H3>

<P>When you have clients and servers spread across multiple subnets, the
polling method is inefficient. CUPS provides a 
<A HREF="#BrowseRelay"><CODE>BrowseRelay</CODE></A> directive that enables a 
single client to relay (broadcast) the polled printer information to the local subnet.</P>

<P>For example, Server A and Server B are on subnet 1 and subnet 2,
while the clients are on subnet 3.
To provide printers to all of the clients in subnet 3,
client C will be configured with the following directives in <VAR>/etc/cups/cupsd.conf</VAR>:</P>

<UL><PRE>
# Poll the two servers
<B>
BrowsePoll ServerA ENTER
BrowsePoll ServerB ENTER
</B>

# Relay the printers to the local subnet
<B>
BrowseRelay 127.0.0.1 192.168.3.255 ENTER
</B></PRE></UL>

<P>The <A HREF="#BrowseRelay"><CODE>BrowseRelay</CODE></A> line specifies a source address and mask.
Any browse packets coming from a matching address wil be sent to the given broadcast address.
In this case, we want the packets from the local machine (127.0.0.1) relayed to the other clients.</P>

<P>As printers are found using polling, 
they are relayed from client C to the rest of the clients through a broadcast on subnet 3.
The rest of the clients can use the standard <VAR>cupsd.conf</VAR> configuration.</P>

<P>The <A HREF="#BrowseRelay"><CODE>BrowseRelay</CODE></A> directive can also be used to relay
browsing packets from one network interface to another.
For example, if client C in the previous example had network interfaces attaches to both
subnet 1 and subnet 2, it could use the <A HREF="#BrowseRelay"><CODE>BrowseRelay</CODE></A> directive exclusively:

<UL><PRE>
# Relay the printers from subnet 1 and 2 to subnet 3
<B>
BrowseRelay 192.168.1 192.168.3.255 ENTER
BrowseRelay 192.168.2 192.168.3.255 ENTER
</B></PRE></UL>

<H2>Load Balancing and Failsafe Operation</H2>

<P>When using server polling or broadcasting, CUPS clients can
automatically merge identical printers on multiple servers into a
single <I>implicit class</I> queue. Clients assume that printers with
the same name on multiple servers are in fact the same printer or type
of printer being served by multiple machines.</P>

<P>If you have two printers, LaserJet@ServerA and LaserJet@ServerB, a
third implicit class called <I>LaserJet</I> will be created
automatically on the client that refers to both printers. If the client
also has a local printer with the name LaserJet then an implicit class
named <I>AnyLaserJet</I> will be created instead.</P>

<P>The client will alternate between servers and automatically stop
sending jobs to a server if it goes down, providing a load-balancing
effect and fail-safe operation with automatic switchover.</P>

<CENTER><TABLE BGCOLOR="#cccccc" BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="5" WIDTH="80%">

<P>This chapter shows how you can configure the CUPS server.

<H2>The Basics</H2>

<P>Several text files are used to configure CUPS. All of the server
configuration files are located in the <VAR>/etc/cups</VAR> directory:

<UL>
<DL>

	<!-- NEED 1in -->
	<DT>classes.conf

	<DD>This file contains information on each printer class.
	Normally you manipulate this file using the
	<CODE>lpadmin</CODE> command or the Web interface.<BR>&nbsp;

	<!-- NEED 1in -->
	<DT>client.conf

	<DD>This file provides the default server name for client
	machines. See <A HREF="#CLIENT_SETUP">Chapter 5, "Client
	Setup"</A> for more information.<BR>&nbsp;

	<!-- NEED 1in -->
	<DT>cupsd.conf

	<DD>This file controls how the CUPS server
	(<VAR>/usr/sbin/cupsd</VAR>) operates and is normally edited by
	hand.<BR>&nbsp;

	<!-- NEED 1in -->
	<DT>mime.convs

	<DD>This file contains a list of standard file conversion filters
	and their costs. You normally do not edit this file.<BR>&nbsp;

	<!-- NEED 1in -->
	<DT>mime.types

	<DD>This file contains a list of standard file formats and how to
	recognize them. You normally do not edit this file.<BR>&nbsp;

	<!-- NEED 1in -->
	<DT>printers.conf

	<DD>This file contains information on each printer. Normally
	you manipulate this file using the <CODE>lpadmin</CODE> command
	or the Web Interface.<BR>&nbsp;

</DL>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="RESTARTING">Restarting the CUPS Server</A></H2>

<P>Once you have made a change to a configuration file you need to
restart the CUPS server by sending it a <CODE>HUP</CODE> signal or using the
supplied initialization script. The CUPS distributions install the
script in the <VAR>init.d</VAR> directory with the name
<VAR>cups</VAR>. The location varies based upon the operating system:

<UL><PRE>
<B>/etc/software/init.d/cups restart ENTER</B>
<B>/etc/rc.d/init.d/cups restart ENTER</B>
<B>/etc/init.d/cups restart ENTER</B>
<B>/sbin/init.d/cups restart ENTER</B>
</PRE></UL>

<H2>Changing the Server Configuration</H2>

<P>The <VAR>/etc/cups/cupsd.conf</VAR> file contains configuration
<I>directives</I> that control how the server functions. Each directive
is listed on a line by itself followed by its value. Comments are
introduced using the number sign ("#") character at the beginning of a
line. Since the server configuration file consists of plain text, you
can use your favorite text editor to make changes to it.

<!-- NEED 4in -->
<H2>Server Directives</H2>

<P>Address based access control allows you to limit access to specific
systems, networks, or domains. While this does not provide authentication,
it does allow you to limit the potential users of your system efficiently.

<P>CUPS maintains a list of locations that have access control and/or

<H3><A NAME="CERTIFICATES">Authentication Using Certificates</A></H3>

<P>CUPS supports a local certificate-based authentication scheme that
can be used in place of <CODE>Basic</CODE> or <CODE>Digest</CODE>
authentication by clients connecting through the <CODE>localhost</CODE>
interface. Certificate authentication is not supported or allowed from
clients on any other interface.

<P>Certificates are 128-bit random numbers that refer to an internal
authentication record in the server. A client connecting via the
<CODE>localhost</CODE> interface sends a request with an
authorization header of:

<UL><PRE>
Authorization: Local 0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF
</PRE></UL>

<P>The server then looks up the local certificate and authenticates
using the username associated with it.

<P>Certificates are generated by the server automatically and stored in
the <VAR>/etc/cups/certs</VAR> directory using the process ID of the
CGI program started by the server. Certificate files are only readable
by the <A HREF="#User"><CODE>User</CODE></A> and
<A HREF="#Group"><CODE>Group</CODE></A> defined in the
<VAR>cupsd.conf</VAR> file. When the CGI program ends the certificate
is removed and invalidated automatically.

<P>The special file <VAR>/etc/cups/certs/0</VAR> defines the <I>root
certificate</I> which can be used by any client running as the super-user
or another user that is part of the group defined by the
<A HREF="#SystemGroup"><CODE>SystemGroup</CODE></A> directive. The
root certificate is automatically regenerated every 5 minutes.

<H3>Using Basic Authentication</H3>

<P>Basic authentication uses UNIX users and passwords to authenticate
access to resources such as printers and classes, and to limit access
to administrative functions.</P>

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="80%" BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="5" BGCOLOR="#cccccc">
<TR>
	<TD>
	<B>NOTE:</B>

	<P>Basic authentication sends the username and password Base64
	encoded from the client to the server, so it offers no
	protection against eavesdropping. This means that a malicious
	user can monitor network packets and discover valid users and
	passwords that could result in a serious compromise in network
	security. Use Basic authentication with extreme care.
	</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>

<P>The CUPS implementation of Basic authentication does not allow access
through user accounts without a password. If you try to authenticate
using an account without a password, your access will be immediately
blocked.

<P>Once a valid username and password is authenticated by CUPS, any
additional group membership requirements are checked.</P>

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="80%" BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="5" BGCOLOR="#cccccc">

<H3>Using Digest Authentication</H3>

<P>Digest authentication uses users and passwords defined in the
<VAR>/etc/cups/passwd.md5</VAR> file to authenticate access to
resources such as printers and classes, and to limit access to
administrative functions.</P>

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="80%" BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="5" BGCOLOR="#cccccc">
<TR>
	<TD>
	<B>NOTE:</B>

	<P>Unlike Basic authentication, Digest passes the MD5 sum
	(basically a complicated checksum) of the username and password
	instead of the strings themselves. Also, Digest authentication
	does not use the UNIX password file, so if an attacker does
	discover the original password it is less likely to result in a
	serious security problem so long as you use a different UNIX
	password than the corresponding Digest password.

	<P>The current CUPS implementation of Digest authentication
	uses the client's hostname or IP address for the "nonce" value.
	The nonce value is an additional string added to the username
	and password to make guessing the password more difficult. The
	server checks that the nonce value matches the client's hostname
	or address and rejects the MD5 sum if it doesn't.  Future versions
	of CUPS will support Digest "session" authentication which adds
	the request data to the MD5 sum, providing even better
	authentication and security.

	<P>Digest authentication does not guarantee that an attacker
	cannot gain unauthorized access, but it is safer than Basic
	authentication and should be used in place of Basic
	authentication whenever possible. <B>Support for Digest
	authentication in web browsers is not yet universally
	available.</B>

<H3>System and Group Authentication</H3>

<P>The <A HREF="#AuthClass"><CODE>AuthClass</CODE></A> directive controls
the level of authentication to perform. <CODE>System</CODE> and
<CODE>Group</CODE> authentication extend the normal user-based authentication
to require membership in a UNIX group. For <CODE>System</CODE> authentication
each user must belong to the <CODE>sys</CODE>, <CODE>system</CODE>, or
<CODE>root</CODE> group; the actual group depends on the operating system.

<P>For <CODE>Group</CODE> authentication each user must belong to the
group named by the <A HREF="#AuthGroupName"><CODE>AuthGroupName</CODE></A>
directive:

<UL><PRE>
&lt;Location /path&gt;
AuthType Digest
AuthClass Group
AuthGroupName mygroup
&lt;/Location&gt;
</PRE></UL>

<P>The named group must be a valid UNIX user group, usually defined in the
<VAR>/etc/group</VAR> or <VAR>/etc/netgroup</VAR> files. Additionally, when
using Digest authentication you need to create user accounts with the named
group:

<UL><PRE>
<B>lppasswd -g mygroup -a user ENTER</B>

editing the <VAR>/etc/cups/cupsd.conf</VAR> configuration file.

<H3>The access_log File</H3>

<P>The <VAR>access_log</VAR> file lists each HTTP resource that is accessed
by a web browser or CUPS/IPP client. Each line is in the so-called "Common

<P>The <I>host</I> field will normally only be an IP address unless you
have enabled the <A HREF="#HostNameLookups"><CODE>HostNameLookups</CODE></A>
directive in the <VAR>cupsd.conf</VAR> file.

<P>The <I>group</I> field always contains "-" in CUPS.

<P>The <I>user</I> field is the authenticated username of the requesting user.
If no username and password is supplied for the request then this field
contains "-".

<P>The <I>date-time</I> field is the date and time of the request in local time
and is in the format:

<UL><PRE>
[DD/MON/YYYY:HH:MM:SS +ZZZZ]
</PRE></UL>

<P>where <I>ZZZZ</I> is the timezone offset in hours and minutes from Greenwich
Mean Time (a.k.a. GMT a.k.a. ZULU.)

<P>The <I>method</I> field is the HTTP method used ("GET", "PUT", "POST", etc.)

<P>The <I>resource</I> field is the filename of the requested resource.

<P>The <I>version</I> field is the HTTP specification version used by the
client. For CUPS clients this will always be "HTTP/1.1".

<P>The <I>status</I> field contains the HTTP result status of the
request. Usually it is "200", but other HTTP status codes are possible.
For example, 401 is the "unauthorized access" status in the example
above.

<P>The <I>bytes</I> field contains the number of bytes in the request.
For POST requests the <I>bytes</I> field contains the number of bytes
that was received from the client.

<H3>The error_log File</H3>

<P>The <VAR>error_log</VAR> file lists messages from the scheduler (errors,
warnings, etc.):

<UL><PRE>

<P>The <I>printer</I> field contains the name of the printer that
printed the page. If you send a job to a printer class, this field will
contain the name of the printer that was assigned the job.

<P>The <I>user</I> field contains the name of the user (the IPP
<CODE>requesting-user-name</CODE> attribute) that submitted this file for
printing.

<P>The <I>job-id</I> field contains the job number of the page being printed.
Job numbers are reset to 1 whenever the CUPS server is started, so don't depend
on this number being unique!

<P>The <I>date-time</I> field contains the date and time of when the page
started printing. The format of this field is identical to the <I>data-time</I>
field in the <VAR>access_log</VAR> file.

<P>The <I>page-number</I> and <I>num-pages</I> fields contain the page number
and number of copies being printed of that page. For printer that can not
produce copies on their own, the <I>num-pages</I> field will always be 1.

<P>The <I>job-billing</I> field contains a copy of the
<CODE>job-billing</CODE> attribute provided with the IPP
<CODE>create-job</CODE> or <CODE>print-job</CODE> requests or "-" if none
was provided.

<H2><A NAME="FILE_TYPING_FILTERING">File Typing and Filtering</A></H2>

<P>CUPS provides a MIME-based file typing and filtering mechanism to
convert files to a printable format for each printer. On startup the
CUPS server reads MIME database files from the <VAR>/etc/cups</VAR>
directory (or a directory specified by the
<A HREF="#ServerRoot"><CODE>ServerRoot</CODE></A> directive) to build
a file type and conversion database in memory. These database files are
plain ASCII text and can be edited with your favorite text editor.

<P>The <VAR>mime.types</VAR> and <VAR>mime.convs</VAR> files define the
standard file types and filters that are available on the system.

<H3>mime.types</H3>

<P>The <VAR>mime.types</VAR> file defines the known file types. Each line
of the file starts with the MIME type and may be followed by one or
more file type recognition rules. For example, the
<CODE>text/html</CODE> file type is defined as:

<UL><PRE>
text/html       html htm \
                printable(0,1024) + \
                (string(0,"&lt;HTML&gt;") string(0,"&lt;!DOCTYPE"))
</PRE></UL>

<P>The first two rules say that any file with an extension of
<VAR>.html</VAR> or <VAR>.htm</VAR> is a HTML file. The third rule
says that any file whose first 1024 characters are printable text and
starts with the strings <CODE>&lt;HTML&gt;</CODE> or
<CODE>&lt;!DOCTYPE</CODE> is a HTML file as well.

<P>The first two rules deal solely with the name of the file being
typed. This is useful when the original filename is known, however for
print files the server doesn't have a filename to work with. The third
rule takes care of this possibility and automatically figures out the
file type based upon the contents of the file instead.

<P>The available tests are:

<UL>

	<LI><CODE>( expr )</CODE> - Parenthesis for expression grouping

	<LI><CODE>+</CODE> - Logical AND

	<LI><CODE>,</CODE> or whitespace - Logical OR

	<LI><CODE>!</CODE> - Logical NOT

	<LI><CODE>match("pattern")</CODE> - Pattern match on filename

	<LI><CODE>extension</CODE> - Pattern match on "*.extension"

	<LI><CODE>ascii(offset,length)</CODE> - True if bytes are valid
	printable ASCII (CR, NL, TAB, BS, 32-126)

	<LI><CODE>printable(offset,length)</CODE> - True if bytes are
	printable 8-bit chars (CR, NL, TAB, BS, 32-126, 160-254)

	<LI><CODE>string(offset,"string")</CODE> - True if bytes are
	identical to string

	<LI><CODE>contains(offset,range,"string")</CODE> - True if the
	range of bytes contains the string

	<LI><CODE>char(offset,value)</CODE> - True if byte is identical

	<LI><CODE>short(offset,value)</CODE> - True if 16-bit integer
	is identical (network or "big-endian" byte order)

	<LI><CODE>int(offset,value)</CODE> - True if 32-bit integer is
	identical (network or "big-endian" byte order)

	<LI><CODE>locale("string")</CODE> - True if current locale
	matches string

</UL>

<P>All numeric values can be in decimal (123), octal (0123), or hexadecimal
(0x123) as desired.

<!-- NEED 2.5in -->
<P>Strings can be in quotes, all by themselves, as a string
of hexadecimal values, or some combination:

<UL><PRE>
"string"
'string'
string
&lt;737472696e67&gt;
&lt;7374&gt;ring
</PRE></UL>

<P>As shown in the <CODE>text/html</CODE> example, rules can continue on
multiple lines using the backslash (\) character. A more complex example is
the <CODE>image/jpeg</CODE> rules:

<UL><PRE>
image/jpeg      jpeg jpg jpe string(0,&lt;FFD8FF&gt;) &amp;&amp;\
                (char(3,0xe0) char(3,0xe1) char(3,0xe2) char(3,0xe3)\
                 char(3,0xe4) char(3,0xe5) char(3,0xe6) char(3,0xe7)\
                 char(3,0xe8) char(3,0xe9) char(3,0xea) char(3,0xeb)\
                 char(3,0xec) char(3,0xed) char(3,0xee) char(3,0xef))
</PRE></UL>

<P>This rule states that any file with an extension of
<VAR>.jpeg</VAR>, <VAR>.jpg</VAR>, or <VAR>.jpe</VAR> is a JPEG file.
In addition, any file starting with the hexadecimal string
<CODE>&lt;FFD8FF&gt;</CODE> (JPEG Start-Of-Image) followed by a
character between and including <CODE>0xe0</CODE> and <CODE>0xef</CODE>
(JPEG APPn markers) is also a JPEG file.

<H3>mime.convs</H3>

<P>The <VAR>mime.convs</VAR> file defines all of the filter programs that
are known to the system. Each line consists of:

<UL><PRE>
source destination cost program

text/plain application/postscript 50 texttops
application/vnd.cups-postscript application/vnd.cups-raster 50 pstoraster
image/* application/vnd.cups-postscript 50 imagetops
image/* application/vnd.cups-raster 50 imagetoraster
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <I>source</I> field is a MIME type, optionally using a wildcard for
the super-type or sub-type (e.g. "text/plain", "image/*", "*/postscript").

<P>The <I>destination</I> field is a MIME type defined in the
<VAR>mime.types</VAR> file.

<P>The <I>cost</I> field defines a relative cost for the filtering
operation from 1 to 100. The cost is used to choose between two
different sets of filters when converting a file. For example, to convert
from <CODE>image/jpeg</CODE> to <CODE>application/vnd.cups-raster</CODE>,
you could use the <CODE>imagetops</CODE> and <CODE>pstoraster</CODE>
filters for a total cost of 100, or the <CODE>imagetoraster</CODE> filter
for a total cost of 50.

<P>The <I>program</I> field defines the filter program to run; the
special program "-" can be used to make two file types equivalent. The
program must accept the standard filter arguments and environment
variables described in the CUPS Interface Design Description and CUPS
Software Programmers Manual:

<UL><PRE>
program job user title options [filename]
</PRE></UL>

<P>If specified, the <I>filename</I> argument defines a file to read
when filtering, otherwise the filter must read from the standard input.
All filtered output must go to the standard output.

<!-- NEED 4in -->
<H3>Adding Filetypes and Filters</H3>

<P>Adding a new file type or filter is fairly straight-forward. Rather
than adding the new type and filter to the <VAR>mime.types</VAR> and
<VAR>mime.convs</VAR> files which are overwritten when you upgrade to a
new version of CUPS, you simple need to create new files with
<VAR>.types</VAR> and <VAR>.convs</VAR> extensions in the
<VAR>/etc/cups</VAR> directory. We recommend that you use the product
or format name, e.g.:

<UL><PRE>
myproduct.types
myproduct.convs
</PRE></UL>

<P>If you are providing a filter for a common file format or printer,
add the company or author name:

<UL><PRE>
acme-msword.types
acme.msword.convs
</PRE></UL>

<P>This will help to prevent name collisions if you install many
different file types and filters.

<P>Once you choose the names for these files, create them using your
favorite text editor as described earlier in this chapter.  Once you
have created the files, restart the <CODE>cupsd</CODE> process as
described earlier in <A HREF="#RESTARTING">"Restarting the CUPS Server"</A>.

<H3>Printer Drivers and PPD Files</H3>

<P>Most CUPS printer drivers utilize one or more printer-specific filters
and a PPD file for each printer model. Printer driver filters are registered
via the PPD file using <CODE>cupsFilter</CODE> attributes:

<UL><PRE>
*cupsFilter: "application/vnd.cups-raster 0 rastertohp"
</PRE></UL>

<P>The filter is specified using the source file type only; the destination
file type is assumed to be <CODE>printer/name</CODE> - suitable for sending
to the printer.

<H3>Writing Your Own Filter or Printer Driver</H3>

<P>CUPS supports an unlimited number of file formats and filters, and can
handle any printer. If you'd like to write a filter or printer driver for
your favorite file format or printer, consult the CUPS Software Programmers
Manual for step-by-step instructions.


<H1 ALIGN="RIGHT"><A NAME="PRINTING_OTHER">7 - Printing with Other Systems</A></H1>

<P>This chapter describes how to print from client systems that use the
LPD, Mac OS, or Windows printing protocols.

<H2>The Basics</H2>

<P>CUPS is based on the IPP protocol, so any system that supports IPP
can send jobs to and receive jobs from CUPS automatically. However, not
all systems support IPP yet. This chapter will show you how to connect
these systems to your CUPS server, either to accept jobs from your
server for printing, or to send jobs to your server.

<H2>Printing from LPD Clients</H2>

<P>CUPS supports limited functionality for LPD-based clients. With LPD you can
print files to specific printers, list the queue status, and so forth. However,
the automatic client configuration and printer options are not supported by
the LPD protocol, so you must manually configure each client for the printers
it needs to access.

<P>The <CODE>cups-lpd(8)</CODE> program provides support for LPD
clients and can be used from either the <CODE>inetd(8)</CODE> or
<CODE>xinetd(8)</CODE> programs. Add the following line to the
<VAR>/etc/inetd.conf</VAR> file to enable LPD support on your
server through the <CODE>inetd</CODE> program:

<UL><PRE>
printer stream tcp nowait lp /usr/lib/cups/daemon/cups-lpd cups-lpd
</PRE></UL>

<P>The path to the <CODE>cups-lpd</CODE> may vary depending on your
installation.

<P>Once you have added this line, send the <CODE>inetd</CODE>
process a <CODE>HUP</CODE> signal or reboot the system:

<UL><PRE>
<B>killall -HUP inetd ENTER</B> [IRIX and some versions of Linux]
<B>kill -HUP <I>pid</I> ENTER [Others]</B>
<B>reboot ENTER [For all systems if the HUP signal fails]</B>
</PRE></UL>

<P>If you are using the <CODE>xinetd</CODE> program, create a
file named <VAR>/etc/xinetd.d/printer</VAR> containing the
following lines:

<UL><PRE>
service printer
{
    socket_type = stream
    protocol = tcp
    wait = no
    user = lp
    server = /usr/lib/cups/daemon/cups-lpd
}
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <CODE>xinetd</CODE> program automatically reads the new
configuration file and enables LPD printing support.

<H2>Printing to LPD Servers</H2>

<P>CUPS provides the <CODE>lpd</CODE> backend for printing to LPD-based
servers and printers. Use a device URI of <CODE>lpd://server/name</CODE>
to print to a printer on an LPD server, where <CODE>server</CODE>
is the hostname or IP address of the server and <CODE>name</CODE> is
the queue name.

<P>Microsoft Windows NT provides an LPD service under the name "TCP/IP
Printing Services". To enable LPD printing on NT, open the "Services"
control panel, select the "TCP/IP Printing Services" service, and click
on the "Start" button. Any shared printer will then be available via
the LPD protocol.

<H2>Printing from Mac OS Clients</H2>

<P>CUPS does not provide Mac OS support directly. However, there are several
free and commercial software packages that do.

<H3>Columbia Appletalk Package (CAP)</H3>

<P>Because the CAP LaserWriter server (<CODE>lwsrv(8)</CODE>) does
not support specification of PPD files, we do not recommend that you
use CAP with CUPS. However, you can run the <CODE>lpsrv</CODE> program
for limited printing with the command:

<UL><PRE>
lwsrv -n "<I>Name</I>" -p <I>printer</I> -a /usr/lib/adicts -f /usr/lib/LW+Fonts
</PRE></UL>

<P>where <CODE>Name</CODE> is the name you want to use when sharing the
printer, and <CODE>printer</CODE> is the name of the CUPS print queue.

<!-- NEED 3in -->
<H3>XINET KA/Spool</H3>

<P>To use your system as a print server for Mac OS clients,
configure each printer using a <CODE>papserver(8)</CODE> in the
<VAR>/usr/adm/appletalk/services</VAR> file, specifying the
corresponding PPD file in the <VAR>/etc/cups/ppd</VAR> directory for
each printer.  For a printer named <CODE>MyPrinter</CODE> the entry
would look like:

<P>To use your system as a print server for Mac OS clients,
configure each printer in the <VAR>papd.conf</VAR> file, specifying the
corresponding PPD file in the <VAR>/etc/cups/ppd</VAR> directory for
each printer. For a printer named <CODE>MyPrinter</CODE> the entry
would look like:

<UL><PRE>
Printer Description:MyPrinter@MyServer:\
        :pr=|/usr/bin/lp -d MyPrinter:\
        :op=daemon:\
        :pd=/etc/cups/ppd/MyPrinter.ppd:

<H2>Printing to Mac OS Servers</H2>

<P>CUPS currently does not provide a backend to communicate with a Mac OS
server. However, you can write and install a short shell script
in the <VAR>/usr/lib/cups/backend</VAR> directory that sends a print file
using the appropriate command. The following is a short script that will
run the <CODE>papif</CODE> command provided with CAP.

<P>After copying this script to <VAR>/usr/lib/cups/backend/cap</VAR>,
specify a device URI of <CODE>cap://server/printer</CODE> to use this
backend with a print queue.

<H2>Printing from Windows Clients</H2>

<P>While CUPS does not provide Windows support directly, the free
SAMBA software package does. SAMBA version 2.0.6 is the first release
of SAMBA that supports CUPS. You can download SAMBA from:

<UL><PRE>
<A HREF="http://www.samba.org">http://www.samba.org</A>
</PRE></UL>

<P>To configure SAMBA for CUPS, edit the <VAR>smb.conf</VAR> file and
replace the existing printing commands and options with the line:

<UL><PRE>
printing = cups
printcap name = cups
</PRE></UL>

<P>That's all there is to it!  Remote users will now be able to browse and
print to printers on your system.

<H3>Exporting Printer Drivers</H3>

<P>You can optionally export printer drivers from your CUPS
server using the <CODE>cupsaddsmb</CODE> command and the SAMBA
2.2.0 or higher software.

<P>Before you can export the printers you must download the
current Adobe PostScript printer drivers from the Adobe web
site (<A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/">http://www.adobe.com/</A>).
Use the free <CODE>unzip</CODE> software to extract the files
from the self-extracting ZIP file containing the drivers; you
will need the following files:

<UL><PRE>
ADFONTS.MFM
ADOBEPS4.DRV
ADOBEPS4.HLP
ADOBEPS5.DLL
ADOBEPSU.DLL
ADOBEPSU.HLP
DEFPRTR2.PPD
ICONLIB.DLL
PSMON.DLL
</PRE></UL>

<P>Copy these files to the <VAR>/usr/share/cups/drivers</VAR>
directory - you may need to rename some of the files so the
filenames are all UPPERCASE.

<P>Next, add a <CODE>print$</CODE> share for the printer
drivers to your <VAR>smb.conf</VAR> file:

<UL><PRE>
[print$]
    comment = Printer Drivers
    path = /etc/samba/drivers
    browseable = yes
    guest ok = no
    read only = yes
    write list = root
</PRE></UL>

<P>The directory for your printer drivers can be anywhere on the
system; just make sure it is writable by the users specified by
the <CODE>write list</CODE> directive. Also, make sure that you
have SAMBA passwords defined for each user in the <CODE>write
list</CODE> using the <CODE>smbpasswd(1)</CODE> command.
Otherwise you will not be able to authenticate 

<P>Finally, run the <CODE>cupsaddsmb</CODE> command to export
the printer drivers for one or more queues:

<UL><PRE>
<B>cupsaddsmb -U root printer1 ... printerN <I>ENTER</I></B>
</PRE></UL>

<P>Running <CODE>cupsaddsmb</CODE> with the <CODE>-a</CODE> option
will export all printers:

<UL><PRE>
<B>cupsaddsmb -U root -a <I>ENTER</I></B>
</PRE></UL>

<H2>Printing to Windows Servers</H2>

<P>CUPS can print to Windows servers in one of two ways. The first way uses
the LPD protocol on the CUPS system and the "TCP/IP Printing Services" on
the Windows system. You can find out more about this configuration in the
<A HREF="#LPD">LPD</A> section earlier in this chapter.

<P>The second way is through the Microsoft Server Message Block ("SMB")
protocol. Support for this protocol is provided with the free SAMBA
software package. You can download SAMBA from:

<UL><PRE>
<A HREF="http://www.samba.org">http://www.samba.org</A>
</PRE></UL>

<P>To configure CUPS for SAMBA, run the following command:

<UL><PRE>
<B>ln -s `which smbspool` /usr/lib/cups/backend/smb ENTER</B>
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <CODE>smbspool(1)</CODE> program is provided with SAMBA starting
with SAMBA 2.0.6. Once you have made the link you can configure your
printers with one of the following device URIs:

<UL><PRE>
smb://workgroup/server/sharename
smb://server/sharename
smb://user:pass@workgroup/server/sharename
smb://user:pass@server/sharename
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <CODE>workgroup</CODE> name need only be specified if your
system is using a different workgroup. The <CODE>user:pass</CODE>
strings are required when printing to Windows NT servers or to shares
with passwords enabled under Windows 95 and 98.

<H1 ALIGN="RIGHT"><A NAME="COMMON_NETWORK">B - Common Network Settings</A></H1>

<P>This appendix covers many of the popular TCP/IP network interfaces
and printer servers available on the market today.

<H2>Configuring a Network Interface</H2>

<P>When you first install a network printer or print server on your
LAN, you need to set the Internet Protocol ("IP") address. On most
higher-end "workgroup" printers, you can set the address through the
printer control panel. However, in most cases you will want to assign
the addresses remotely from your workstation. This makes administration
a bit easier and avoids assigning duplicate addresses accidentally.

<P>To setup your printer or print server for remote address assignment,
you'll need the Ethernet Media Access Control ("MAC") address, also
sometimes called a node address, and the IP address you want to use for
the device. The Ethernet MAC address can often be found on the printer
test page or bottom of the print server.

<!-- NEED 3in -->
<H3>Configuring the IP Address Using ARP</H3>

<P>The easiest way to set the IP address of a network device is to use
the <CODE>arp(8)</CODE> command.  The <CODE>arp</CODE> sends an Address
Resolution Protocol ("ARP") packet to the specified Ethernet MAC address,
setting the network device's IP address:

<UL><PRE>
<B>arp -s ip-address ethernet-address ENTER</B>
<B>arp -s host.domain.com 08:00:69:00:12:34 ENTER</B>
<B>arp -s 192.0.2.2 08:00:69:00:12:34 ENTER</B>
</PRE></UL>

<H3>Configuring the IP Address Using RARP</H3>

<P>The most flexible way to remotely assign IP addresses under UNIX
is through the Reverse Address Resolution Protocol ("RARP"). RARP
allows a network device to request an IP address using its Ethernet
MAC address, and one or more RARP servers on the network will
respond with an ARP packet with the IP address the device can use.

<P>RARP should be used when you have to manage many printers or print
servers, or when you have a network device that does not remember its
IP address after a power cycle. If you just have a single printer or
print server, the <CODE>arp</CODE> command is the way to go.

<P>Some UNIX operating systems use a program called
<CODE>rarpd(8)</CODE> to manage RARP. Others, like Linux, support this
protocol in the kernel. For systems that provide the <CODE>rarpd</CODE>
program you will need to start it before RARP lookups will work:

<UL><PRE>
<B>rarpd ENTER</B>
</PRE></UL>

<P>Under IRIX you can enable this functionality by default using:

<UL><PRE>
<B>chkconfig rarpd on ENTER</B>
</PRE></UL>

<P>Both the <CODE>rarpd</CODE> program and kernel RARP support read a
list of Ethernet and IP addresses from the file <VAR>/etc/ethers</VAR>.
Each line contains the Ethernet address (colon delimited) followed by
an IP address or hostname like:

<UL><PRE>
08:00:69:00:12:34 myprinter.mydomain.com
08:00:69:00:12:34 192.0.2.2
</PRE></UL>

<P>Add a line to this file and cycle the power on the printer or print
server to set its address.

<!-- NEED 2in -->
<H3>Configuring the IP Address Using BOOTP</H3>

<P>The BOOTP protocol is used when you need to provide additional information
such as the location of a configuration file to the network interface. Using
the standard <CODE>bootpd(8)</CODE> program supplied with UNIX you simply need to
add a line to the <VAR>/etc/bootptab</VAR> file; for IRIX:

<UL><PRE>
myprinter 08:00:69:00:12:34 192.0.2.2 <VAR>myprinter.boot</VAR>
</PRE></UL>

<!-- NEED 1in -->
<P>Newer versions of <CODE>bootpd</CODE> use a different format:

<UL><PRE>
myprinter:ha=080069001234:ip=192.0.2.2:<VAR>t144=myprinter.boot</VAR>
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <VAR>myprinter.boot</VAR> file resides in the <VAR>/usr/local/boot</VAR>
directory by default. If you do not need to provide a boot file you may leave
the last part of the line blank.</P>

<!-- NEED 2in -->
<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="80%" BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="5" BGCOLOR="#cccccc">
<TR>
	<TD>
	<B>NOTE:</B>

	<P>Some versions of UNIX do not enable the BOOTP service by
	default. The <VAR>/etc/inetd.conf</VAR> usually contains a
	line for the BOOTP service that can be uncommented if
	needed.
	</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>

<H2>Verifying the Printer Connection</H2>

<P>To test that the IP address has been successfully assigned and that the
printer is properly connected to your LAN, type:

<UL><PRE>
<B>ping ip-address ENTER</B>
</PRE></UL>

<P>If the connection is working properly you will see something like:

<UL><PRE>
<B>ping myprinter ENTER</B>
PING myprinter (192.0.2.2): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.0.2.2: icmp_seq=0 ttl=15 time=5 ms
64 bytes from 192.0.2.2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=15 time=3 ms
64 bytes from 192.0.2.2: icmp_seq=2 ttl=15 time=3 ms
64 bytes from 192.0.2.2: icmp_seq=3 ttl=15 time=3 ms
</PRE></UL>

<P>If not, verify that the printer or print server is connected to the
LAN, it is powered on, the LAN cabling is good, and the IP address is
set correctly. You can usually see the current IP address and network
status by printing a configuration or test page on the device.

<!-- NEED 4in -->
<H2>Common Network Interface Settings</H2>

<P>Once you have set the IP address you can access the printer or print
server using the <CODE>ipp</CODE>, <CODE>lpd</CODE>, or
<CODE>socket</CODE> backends. The following is a list of common network
interfaces and printer servers and the settings you should use with
CUPS:

<P>The EPSON Stylus Photo driver (<VAR>stphoto.ppd</VAR>) supports
EPSON Stylus Photo printers that implement the ESC/P2 command set. It
provides 180, 360, and 720 DPI output in black and color (CMYKcm).

<H2><A NAME="DESKJET">HP DeskJet</A></H2>

<P>The HP DeskJet driver (<VAR>deskjet.ppd</VAR>) supports HP DeskJet
printers that implement the PCL command set. It provides 150, 300, and
600 DPI output in black and color (CMYK).

<P>The DeskJet printers that implement the HP-PPA command set (720C,
722C, 820C, and 1100C) are <B>not</B> supported due to a complete lack
of documentation and support from Hewlett Packard.

<P>The duplexer provided with the HP DeskJet 900 series printers is also
not supported for similar reasons.

<H2><A NAME="LASERJET">HP LaserJet</A></H2>

<P>The HP LaserJet driver (<VAR>laserjet.ppd</VAR>) supports HP
LaserJet printers that implement the PCL command set. It provides 150,
300, and 600 DPI output in black only and supports the duplexer if
installed.

<P>LaserJet printers that do not implement PCL (3100, 3150) are not
supported due to a complete lack of documentation and support from
Hewlett Packard.

<H1 ALIGN="RIGHT"><A NAME="FAQ">E - Troubleshooting Common Problems</A></H1>

<P>This appendix covers some of the common problems first-time users
encounter when installing and configuring CUPS.

<P>Commercial support for CUPS is available from Easy Software Products.

</UL>

<H2>My Applications Don't See the Available Printers</H2>

<P>Many applications read the <VAR>/etc/printcap</VAR> file to
get a list of available printers.

<P>The default CUPS configuration creates the
<VAR>/etc/printcap</VAR> file automatically. To enable or
disable automatic creation and updating of this file, use the <A
HREF="#Printcap"><CODE>Printcap</CODE></A> directive described
in <A HREF="#PRINTING_MANAGEMENT">Chapter 6, "Printing System
Management"</A>.

<H2>CUPS Doesn't Recognize My Username or Password!</H2>

<P>CUPS will ask you for a UNIX username and password when you perform
printer administration tasks remotely or via a web browser. The default
configuration requires that you use the <CODE>root</CODE> username and
the corresponding password to authenticate the request.

<P>CUPS does not allow you to authenticate an administration request
with an account that has no password for security reasons. If you do
not have a password on your <CODE>root</CODE> account then you won't be
able to add printers remotely or via the web interface!

<!-- NEED 2in -->
<P>To disable password authentication you need to edit the
<VAR>/etc/cups/cupsd.conf</VAR> file and comment out the
lines reading:

<UL><PRE>
AuthType Basic
AuthClass System
</PRE></UL>

<P>for the <VAR>/admin</VAR> location. Then restart the CUPS server as
described in <A HREF="#PRINTING_MANAGEMENT">Chapter 6, "Printing System
Management"</A>.</P>

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="80%" BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="5" BGCOLOR="#cccccc">
<TR>
	<TD>
	<B>NOTE:</B>

	<P>Disabling password checks will allow any local user to
	change your printer and class configuration, but remote
	administration from another machine will still not be allowed.
	</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>

<H2><A NAME="ALLOW_REMOTE">I Can't Do Administration Tasks from Another Machine!</A></H2>

<P>The default CUPS configuration limits administration to the local
machine. To open up access, edit the <VAR>/etc/cups/cupsd.conf</VAR>
and comment out the lines reading:

<UL><PRE>
Order deny,allow
Deny from all
Allow from 127.0.0.1
</PRE></UL>

<P>for the <VAR>/admin</VAR> location. Then restart the CUPS server as
described in <A HREF="#PRINTING_MANAGEMENT">Chapter 6, "Printing System
Management"</A>.</P>

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="80%" BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="5" BGCOLOR="#cccccc">
<TR>
	<TD>
	<B>NOTE:</B>

	<P>Allowing administration access from all hosts is a potential
	security risk. Please read <A HREF="#PRINTING_SECURITY">Chapter
	6, "Printing System Management"</A> for a description of these
	risks and ways to minimize them.
	</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>

<!-- NEED 4in -->
<H2>I Can't Do Administration Tasks from My Web Browser!</H2>

<P>This problem is usually caused by:

<OL>

	<LI>not specifying the correct password for the
	root account.

	<LI>accessing the CUPS server using the hostname or IP
	address of the server without enabling remote access for
	administration functions. This can be corrected by following
	the instructions in the <A HREF="#ALLOW_REMOTE">"I Can't Do
	Administration Tasks from Another Machine!"</A> section earlier
	in this appendix.

	<LI>not setting a password on the root account. CUPS will not
	authenticate a user account that does not have a password for
	security reasons.

	<LI>authenticating using an account other than root, but the
	account you are using is not a member of the system group.

	<LI>configuring CUPS to use Digest authentication, but
	your web browser does not support Digest authentication.

</OL>

<H2>Connection Refused Messages</H2>

<P>Under normal circumstances, "connection refused" messages for a
networked printer should be expected from time to time. Most network
interfaces only allow a single connection to be made at any given time
(one job at a time) and will refuse access to all other systems while
the first connection is active. CUPS automatically retries the
connection once every 30 seconds.

<P>If the problem persists and you are unable to print any jobs to the printer,
verify that another machine is not maintaining a connection with the printer,
and that you have selected the proper port or printer name for the printer.

<P>Also, most external print servers will refuse connections if the connected
printer is turned off or is off-line. Verify that the affected printer is
turned on and is online.

<H2>Write Error Messages</H2>

<P>If you get "write error" messages on a printer queue the printer
interface (usually a Hewlett Packard JetDirect interface) has timed out
and reset the network connection from your workstation.

<P>The error is caused by that startup delay between the initial setup
of the printer or plotter and the first page of print data that is
sent.

<!-- NEED 3in -->
<P>To correct the problem, change the idle timeout on the interface to at least
180 seconds or 3 minutes. To change the timeout on a Hewlett Packard
JetDirect interface, type:

<UL><PRE>
<B>telnet ip-address ENTER</B>

Trying ip-address...
Connected to ip-address.
Escape character is `^]'.

Please type [Return] two times, to initialize telnet configuration
For HELP type "?"
> <B>idle-timeout: 180 ENTER</B>
> <B>quit ENTER</B>
</PRE></UL>
