<H2>Identification</H2>

<P>This interface design description document provides detailed file
formats, message formats, and program conventions for the Common UNIX
Printing System ("CUPS") Version 1.1.

<EMBED SRC="system-overview.shtml">

<H2>Document Overview</H2>

<P>This interface design description document is organized into the following
sections:

<UL>
	<LI>1 - Scope
	<LI>2 - References
	<LI>3 - Internal Interfaces
	<LI>4 - External Interfaces
	<LI>5 - Directories
	<LI>A - Glossary

<H1>Internal Interfaces</H1>

<H2>Character Set Files</H2>

<P>The character set files define a mapping between 8-bit characters
and the Unicode character set, or between Unicode and printer fonts.
They are named using the IETF charset names defined in RFCnnnn.  These
files are ASCII text, the content of which is described below. Comments
can be included by using the <TT>#</TT> character in the first column
of a line.

<H3>8-Bit Character Set Files</H3>

<P>8-bit character set files start with a line reading:

<UL><PRE>
charset 8bit
</PRE></UL>

<P>Following this is a line that defines the font information:

<UL><PRE>
direction width normal bold italic bold-italic
</PRE></UL>

<P><VAR>Direction</VAR> is the string "ltor", "rtol", or "rtola" indicating
left-to-right, right-to-left, or right-to-left Arabic text.

<P><VAR>Width</VAR> is the string "single" or "double"; double means that the
glyphs are twice as wide as ASCII characters in the Courier typeface.

<P><VAR>Normal, bold, italic</VAR>, and <VAR>bold-italic</VAR> are the
typefaces to use for each presentation.  If characters are only available in
a single style then only one typeface should be listed (e.g. "Symbol".)
Each font that is listed will be used (and downloaded if needed) when
printing.

<P>The remaining lines define a character to Unicode glyph mapping for the
character set. The character and glyph values are hexadecimal.

<H3>Unicode Character Set Files</H3>

<P>Unicode character set files start with a line reading:

<UL><PRE>
charset encoding
</PRE></UL>

<P><VAR>Encoding</VAR> is the encoding to use for the text; currently only
the string "utf8" is supported.

<P>Following this are lines defining the font information:

<UL><PRE>
first last direction width normal bold italic bold-italic
</PRE></UL>

<P><VAR>First</VAR> and <VAR>last</VAR> are the first and last glyphs
in the font mapping that correspond to that font; a maximum of 256
characters can be mapped within each group, with a maximum of 256
mappings (this is a PostScript limitation.) The glyph values are
hexadecimal.

<P><VAR>Direction</VAR> is the string "ltor", "rtol", or "rtola" indicating
left-to-right, right-to-left, or right-to-left Arabic text.

<P><VAR>Width</VAR> is the string "single" or "double"; double means that the
glyphs are twice as wide as ASCII characters in the Courier typeface.

<P><VAR>Normal, bold, italic</VAR>, and <VAR>bold-italic</VAR> are the
typefaces to use for each presentation.  If characters are only available in
a single style then only one typeface should be listed (e.g. "Symbol".)
Each font that is listed will be used (and downloaded if needed) when
printing.

<H2>Language Files</H2>

<P>The language files define the default character set and a collection of
text messages in that language. They are named by prefixing the string "cups_"
to the front of the language specifier (e.g. "cups_en", "cups_fr", etc.) Each
file consists of two or more lines of ASCII text.

<P>The first line identifies the character set to be used for the messages.
The currently recognized values are:

<UL>
	<LI>cp874
	<LI>cp1250
	<LI>cp1251
	<LI>cp1252
	<LI>cp1253
	<LI>cp1254
	<LI>cp1255
	<LI>cp1256
	<LI>cp1257
	<LI>cp1258
	<LI>iso-8859-1
	<LI>iso-8859-2
	<LI>iso-8859-3
	<LI>iso-8859-4
	<LI>iso-8859-5
	<LI>iso-8859-6
	<LI>iso-8859-7
	<LI>iso-8859-8
	<LI>iso-8859-9
	<LI>iso-8859-14
	<LI>iso-8859-15
	<LI>us-ascii
	<LI>utf-8
</UL>

<P>The second and succeeding lines define text messages. If the message text
is preceded by a number, then the current message number is updated and the
text after the number is used.

<H2>MIME Files</H2>

<P>CUPS uses two MIME files in its standard configuration.

<H3>mime.types</H3>

<P>The mime.types file defines the recognized file types and consists
of 1 or more lines of ASCII text. Comment lines start with the pound
("#") character. The backslash ("\") character can be used at the end
of a line to continue that line to the next.

<P>Each non-blank line starts with a MIME type identifier ("super/type")
as registered with the IANA. All text following the MIME type is treated as
a series of type recognition rules:

<UL><PRE>
mime-type := super "/" type { SP rule }*
super := { "a-z" | "A-Z" }*
type := { "a-z" | "A-Z" | "-" | "." | "0-9" }*
rule := { extension | match | operator | "(" rule ")" }*
extension := { "a-z" | "A-Z" | "0-9" }*
match := "match(" regexp ")" |
         "ascii(" offset "," length ")" |
	 "printable(" offset "," length ")" |
	 "string(" offset "," string ")" |
	 "contains(" offset "," length "," string ")" |
	 "char(" offset "," value ")" |
	 "short(" offset "," value ")" |
	 "int(" offset "," value ")" |
	 "locale(" string ")"
operator := "+" |	[ logical AND ]
            "," | SP    [ logical OR ]
	    "!"         [ unary NOT ]
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <CODE>int</CODE> and <CODE>short</CODE> rules match look for integers
in network byte order (a.k.a. big-endian) with the most-significant byte first.

<H3>mime.convs</H3>

<P>The mime.types file defines the recognized file filters and consists
of 1 or more lines of ASCII text. Comment lines start with the pound
("#") character.

<P>Each non-blank line starts with two MIME type identifiers ("super/type")
representing the source and destination types. Following the MIME types are
a cost value (0 to 100) and the filter program to use. If the filter program
is not specified using the full path then it must reside in the CUPS filter
directory.

<H2>Option Files</H2>

<P>CUPS maintains user-defined printer and option files for each
printer and user on the system. The printers and options defined in the
system option file (<CODE>/etc/cups/lpoptions</CODE>) are loaded first,
followed by the user option file (<CODE>$HOME/.lpoptions</CODE>).
Options in the user file replace those defined in the system file for
the same destination. Each line in the files can be one of the
following:

<UL><PRE>
Dest name option=value option=value ... option=value
Dest name/instance option=value option=value ... option=value
Default name option=value option=value ... option=value
Default name/instance option=value option=value ... option=value
</PRE></UL>

<P>The line beginning with "Default" indicates the default destination for
print jobs; a default line in the user option file overrides the default
defined in the system option file.

<P><VAR>Name</VAR> is the name of a printer known to the local server.

<P><VAR>Instance</VAR> can be any string of letters, numbers, and the underscore
up to 127 characters in length.

<P>The remainder of the line contains a list of space-separated options
and their values.

<H2>PostScript Printer Description Files</H2>

<P>PostScript Printer Description ("PPD") files describe the capabilities
of each printer and are used by CUPS to support printer-specific features
and intelligent filtering.

<H3>PPD Specification</H3>

<P>The PPD file format is described in
<A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/PDFS/TN/5003.PPD_Spec_v4.3.pdf">
Adobe TechNote #5003: PostScript Printer Description File Format
Specification Version 4.3</A>.

<H3>CUPS Extensions to PPD Files</H3>

<P>CUPS adds several new attributes that are described below.

<H4>cupsFilter</H4>

<P>This string attribute provides a conversion rule of the form:

<UL><PRE>
source/type cost program
</PRE></UL>

<P>The destination type is assumed to the printer's type. If a printer
supports the source type directly the special filter program "-" may be
specified.

<H4>cupsManualCopies</H4>

<P>This boolean attribute notifies the RIP filters that the destination printer
does not support copy generation in hardware. The default value is false.

<H4>cupsModelNumber</H4>

<P>This integer attribute specifies a printer-specific model number. This number
can be used by a filter program to adjust the output for a specific model of
printer.

<H4>cupsProfile</H4>

<P>This string attribute specifies a color profile of the form:

<UL><PRE>
resolution/type density gamma m00 m01 m02 m10 m11 m12 m20 m21 m22
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <I>resolution</I> and <I>type</I> values may be "-" to act as a
wildcard. Otherwise they must match one of the <CODE>Resolution</CODE> or
<CODE>MediaType</CODE> attributes defined in the PPD file.

<P>The <I>density</I> and <I>gamma</I> values define gamma and density
adjustment function such that:

<UL><PRE>
f(x) = density * x<SUP>gamma</SUP>
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <I>m00</I> through <I>m22</I> values define a 3x3 transformation
matrix for the CMY color values. The density function is applied <I>after</I>
the CMY transformation.

<H4>cupsVersion</H4>

<P>This required attribute describes which version of the CUPS IDD was used
for the PPD file extensions. Currently it must be the string "1.0" or "1.1".

<H2>Scheduler Configuration Files</H2>

<P>The scheduler reads three configuration files that define the available
printers, classes, and services:

<DL>

	<DT>classes.conf
	<DD>This file defines all of the printer classes known to the
	system.

	<DT>cupsd.conf
	<DD>This file defines the files, directories, passwords, etc.
	used by the scheduler.

	<DT>printers.conf
	<DD>This file defines all of the printers known to the system.

</DL>

<H3>classes.conf</H3>

<P>The classes.conf file consists of 1 or more lines of ASCII text. 
Comment lines start with the pound ("#") character.

<P>Each non-blank line starts with the name of a configuration directive
followed by its value. The following directives are understood:

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="90%" BORDER="1">

<H1>External Interfaces</H1>

<H2>AppSocket Protocol</H2>

<P>The AppSocket protocol is an 8-bit clean TCP/IP socket connection.
The default IP service port is 9100. The URI method name is "socket".

<P>The AppSocket protocol is used by the Hewlett Packard JetDirect
network interfaces and print servers, as well as many other vendors'
products. See the CUPS Software Administrators Manual for a list of
supported products.

<H2>CUPS Browsing Protocol</H2>

<P>The CUPS Browsing Protocol is a UDP/IP-based broadcast service. By default
this service operates on IP service port 631.

<P>Each broadcast packet describes the state of a single printer or class and
is an ASCII text string of up to 1450 bytes ending with a newline (0x0a). The
string is formatted as follows:

<UL><PRE>
type SP state SP uri SP "location" SP "info" SP "make-and-model" NL
</PRE></UL>

<P><VAR>State, uri, location, info</VAR>, and <VAR>make-and-model</VAR>,

<H2>CUPS PostScript File</H2>

<P>CUPS PostScript files are device-dependent Adobe PostScript program files.
The PostScript language is described in the
<A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/PDFS/TN/PLRM.pdf">
Adobe PostScript Language Reference Manual, Third Edition</A>.

<P>The MIME type for CUPS PostScript files is
<CODE>application/vnd.cups-postscript</CODE>.

<H2>CUPS Raster File</H2>

<P>CUPS raster files are device-dependent raster image files that contain a
PostScript page device dictionary and device-dependent raster imagery for
each page in the document.  These files are used to transfer raster data
from the PostScript and image file RIPs to device-dependent filters that
convert the raster data to a printable format.

<P>A raster file begins with a four byte synchronization word: 0x52615374
("RaSt") for big-endian architectures and 0x74536152 ("tSaR") for little-endian
architectures.  The writer of the raster file will use the native word order,
and the reader is responsible for detecting a reversed word order file and
swapping bytes as needed. The CUPS Image Library raster functions perform
this function automatically.

<P>Following the synchronization word are a series of raster pages.  Each page
starts with a page device dictionary header and is followed immediately by the
raster data for that page.
