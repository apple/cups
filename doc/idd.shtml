<H1>Scope</H1>

<H2>Identification</H2>

<P>This interface design description document provides detailed file
formats, message formats, and program conventions for the Common UNIX
Printing System ("CUPS") Version 1.1.

<H2>System Overview</H2>

<P>The Common UNIX Printing System provides a portable printing layer for 
UNIX&reg; operating systems. It has been developed by Easy Software 
Products to promote a standard printing solution for all UNIX vendors 
and users. CUPS provides the System V and Berkeley command-line interfaces.

<P>CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol (IETF-IPP) as the basis
for managing print jobs and queues. The Line Printer Daemon (LPD,
RFC1179), Server Message Block (SMB), and AppSocket protocols are also
supported with reduced functionality.

<P>CUPS adds network printer browsing and PostScript Printer
Description (&quot;PPD&quot;)-based printing options to support real
world applications under UNIX.

<P>CUPS also includes a customized version of GNU GhostScript
(currently based off GNU GhostScript 4.03) and an image file RIP that
can be used to support non-PostScript printers.

<H1>Internal Interfaces</H1>

<H2>Character Set Files</H2>

<P>The character set files define a mapping between 8-bit characters
and the Unicode character set. They are named using the ISO standard
number defined for the character set. Each file consists of up to 256
lines of ASCII text. Each line consists of two hexadecimal numbers; the
first number is the character number in the character set (0x00 to
0xff), and the second number is the Unicode character number (0x0000 to
0xffff).

<H2>Language Files</H2>

<P>The language files define the default character set and a collection of
text messages in that language. They are named by prefixing the string "cups_"
to the front of the language specifier (e.g. "cups_en", "cups_fr", etc.) Each
file consists of two or more lines of ASCII text.

<P>The first line identifies the character set to be used for the messages.
The currently recognized values are:

<UL>
	<LI>us-ascii
	<LI>utf-8
	<LI>iso-8859-1
	<LI>iso-8859-2
	<LI>iso-8859-3
	<LI>iso-8859-4
	<LI>iso-8859-5
	<LI>iso-8859-6
	<LI>iso-8859-7
	<LI>iso-8859-8
	<LI>iso-8859-9
	<LI>iso-8859-14
	<LI>iso-8859-15
</UL>

<P>The second and succeeding lines define text messages. If the message text
is preceded by a number, then the current message number is updated and the
text after the number is used.

<H2>MIME Files</H2>

<P>CUPS uses two MIME files in its standard configuration.

<H3>mime.types</H3>

<P>The mime.types file defines the recognized file types and consists
of 1 or more lines of ASCII text. Comment lines start with the pound
("#") character. The backslash ("\") character can be used at the end
of a line to continue that line to the next.

<P>Each non-blank line starts with a MIME type identifier ("super/type")
as registered with the IANA. All text following the MIME type is treated as
a series of type recognition rules:

<UL><PRE>
mime-type := super "/" type { SP rule }*
super := { "a-z" | "A-Z" }*
type := { "a-z" | "A-Z" | "-" | "." | "0-9" }*
rule := { extension | match | operator | "(" rule ")" }*
extension := { "a-z" | "A-Z" | "0-9" }*
match := "match(" regexp ")" |
         "ascii(" offset "," length ")" |
	 "printable(" offset "," length ")" |
	 "string(" offset "," string ")" |
	 "char(" offset "," value ")" |
	 "short(" offset "," value ")" |
	 "int(" offset "," value ")" |
	 "locale(" string ")"
operator := "+" |	[ logical AND ]
            "," | SP    [ logical OR ]
	    "!"         [ unary NOT ]
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <CODE>int</CODE> and <CODE>short</CODE> rules match look for integers
in network byte order (a.k.a. big-endian) with the most-significant byte first.

<H3>mime.convs</H3>

<P>The mime.types file defines the recognized file filters and consists
of 1 or more lines of ASCII text. Comment lines start with the pound
("#") character.

<P>Each non-blank line starts with two MIME type identifiers ("super/type")
representing the source and destination types. Following the MIME types are
a cost value (0 to 100) and the filter program to use. If the filter program
is not specified using the full path then it must reside in the CUPS filter
directory.

<H2>PostScript Printer Description Files</H2>

<P>The PostScript Printer Description (PPD) file format is described in
<A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/supportservice/devrelations/PDFS/TN/5003.PPD_Spec_v4.3.pdf">
Adobe TechNote #5003: PostScript Printer Description File Format
Specification Version 4.3</A>.

<H3>CUPS Extensions to PPD Files</H3>

<P>CUPS adds several new attributes that are described below.

<H4>cupsFilter</H4>

<P>This string attribute provides a conversion rule of the form:

<UL><PRE>
source/type cost program
</PRE></UL>

<P>The destination type is assumed to the printer's type. If a printer
supports the source type directly the special filter program "-" may be
specified.

<H4>cupsManualCopies</H4>

<P>This boolean attribute notifies the RIP filters that the destination printer
does not support copy generation in hardware. The default value is false.

<H4>cupsModelNumber</H4>

<P>This integer attribute specifies a printer-specific model number. This number
can be used by a filter program to adjust the output for a specific model of
printer.

<H4>cupsProfile</H4>

<P>This string attribute specifies a color profile of the form:

<UL><PRE>
resolution/type density gamma m00 m01 m02 m10 m11 m12 m20 m21 m22
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <I>resolution</I> and <I>type</I> values may be "-" to act as a
wildcard. Otherwise they must match one of the <CODE>Resolution</CODE> or
<CODE>MediaType</CODE> attributes defined in the PPD file.

<P>The <I>density</I> and <I>gamma</I> values define gamma and density
adjustment function such that:

<UL><PRE>
f(x) = density * x<SUP>gamma</SUP>
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <I>m00</I> through <I>m22</I> values define a 3x3 transformation
matrix for the CMY color values. The density function is applied <I>after</I>
the CMY transformation.

<H4>cupsVersion</H4>

<P>This required attribute describes which version of the CUPS IDD was used
for the PPD file extensions. Currently it must be the string "1.1".

<H2>Scheduler Configuration Files</H2>

<P>The scheduler reads three configuration files that define the available
printers, classes, and services:

<DL>

	<DT>classes.conf
	<DD>This file defines all of the printer classes known to the
	system.

	<DT>cupsd.conf
	<DD>This file defines the files, directories, passwords, etc.
	used by the scheduler.

	<DT>printers.conf
	<DD>This file defines all of the printers known to the system.

</DL>

<H3>classes.conf</H3>

<P>The classes.conf file consists of 1 or more lines of ASCII text. 
Comment lines start with the pound ("#") character.

<P>Each non-blank line starts with the name of a configuration directive
followed by its value. The following directives are understood:

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="90%" BORDER="1">

<H2>AppSocket Protocol</H2>

<P>The AppSocket protocol is an 8-bit clean TCP/IP socket connection.
The default IP service port is 9100. The URI method name is "socket".

<H2>CUPS Browsing Protocol</H2>

<P>The CUPS Browsing Protocol is a UDP/IP-based broadcast service. By default
this service operates on IP service port 631.

<P>Each broadcast packet describes the state of a single printer or class and
is an ASCII text string of up to 1450 bytes ending with a newline (0x0a). The
string is formatted as follows:

<UL><PRE>
type SP state SP uri NL

<H2>CUPS PostScript File</H2>

<P>CUPS PostScript files are device-dependent Adobe PostScript program files.
The PostScript language is described in the
<A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/supportservice/devrelations/PDFS/TN/PLRM.pdf">
Adobe PostScript Language Reference Manual, Third Edition</A>.

<P>The MIME type for CUPS PostScript files is
<CODE>application/vnd.cups-postscript</CODE>.

<H2>CUPS Raster File</H2>

<P>CUPS raster files are device-dependent raster image files that contain a
PostScript page device dictionary and device-dependent raster imagery for
each page in the document.  These files are used to transfer raster data
from the PostScript and image file RIPs to device-dependent filters that
convert the raster data to a printable format.

<P>A raster file begins with a four byte synchronization word: 0x52615374
("RaSt") for big-endian architectures and 0x74536152 ("tSaR") for little-endian
architectures.  The writer of the raster file will use the native word order,
and the reader is responsible for detecting a reversed word order file and
swapping bytes as needed. The CUPS Interface Library raster functions perform
this function automatically.

<P>Following the synchronization word are a series of raster pages.  Each page
starts with a page device dictionary header and is followed immediately by the
raster data for that page.

<P>The MIME type for CUPS Raster files is
<CODE>application/vnd.cups-raster</CODE>.

<H2>CUPS Raw Files</H2>

<P>Raw files are printer-dependent print files that are in a format suitable
to the destination printer (e.g. HP-PCL, HP-RTL, etc.) The MIME type for CUPS
Raw files is <CODE>application/vnd.cups-raw</CODE>.

<H2>Internet Printing Protocol</H2>

<P>The Internet Printing Protocol is described by the following RFCs:

<UL>

	<LI><A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2565.txt">
	RFC 2565: Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Encoding and Transport</A>

	<LI><A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2566.txt">
	RFC 2566: Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Model and Semantics</A>

	<LI><A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2567.txt">
	RFC 2567: Design Goals for an Internet Printing Protocol</A>

	<LI><A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2568.txt">
	RFC 2568: Rationale for the Structure of the Model and Protocol
        for the Internet Printing Protocol</A>

	<LI><A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2569.txt">
	RFC 2569: Mapping between LPD and IPP Protocols</A>

</UL>

<P>The URI method name for IPP is "ipp".

<P>CUPS defines the following extension operations to IPP.

<H3>Get Default Destination (CUPS_GET_DEFAULT = 0x4001)</H3>

<P>The get default destination operation returns the printer attributes
for the system default printer or class. The only required attributes
are <CODE>attributes-charset</CODE> and
<CODE>attributes-natural-language</CODE>.

<P>Get default destination will only return <CODE>ipp-ok</CODE>.

<H3>Get Printers (CUPS_GET_PRINTERS = 0x4002)</H3>

<P>The get printers operation returns the printer attributes for all
printers known to the system. The only required attributes are
<CODE>attributes-charset</CODE> and
<CODE>attributes-natural-language</CODE>.

<P>Get printers will only return <CODE>ipp-ok</CODE>.

<H3>Add Printer (CUPS_ADD_PRINTER = 0x4003)</H3>

<P>The add printer operation adds or replaces the specified printer. The
<CODE>attributes-charset</CODE>,
<CODE>attributes-natural-language</CODE> and <CODE>printer-uri</CODE>
attributes are required.

<P>The <CODE>printer-location</CODE>, <CODE>printer-info</CODE>,
<CODE>printer-more-info</CODE>, and <CODE>device-uri</CODE> attributes
are required when initially adding a printer and optional when modifying
a printer.

<P>A PPD file or System V interface script may follow the IPP request
body. If a valid interface script or PPD file is not provided then the
printer is treated as a generic PostScript device.

<P>Add printer will return <CODE>ipp-ok</CODE>, <CODE>ipp-not-authorized</CODE>,
<CODE>ipp-bad-request</CODE>, or <CODE>ipp-attributes</CODE>.

<H3>Delete Printer (CUPS_DELETE_PRINTER = 0x4004)</H3>

<P>The delete printer operation removes the specified printer. The only
required attributes are <CODE>attributes-charset</CODE>,
<CODE>attributes-natural-language</CODE>, and <CODE>printer-uri</CODE>.

<P>Delete printer will return <CODE>ipp-ok</CODE>, <CODE>ipp-not-found</CODE>,
or <CODE>ipp-not-authorized</CODE>.

<H3>Get Classes (CUPS_GET_CLASSES = 0x4005)</H3>

<P>The get classes operation returns the printer attributes for all
classes known to the system. The only required attributes are
<CODE>attributes-charset</CODE> and
<CODE>attributes-natural-language</CODE>.

<P>Get classes will only return <CODE>ipp-ok</CODE>.

<H3>Add Class (CUPS_ADD_CLASS = 0x4006)</H3>

<P>The add class operation adds or replaces the specified class. The
<CODE>attributes-charset</CODE>,
<CODE>attributes-natural-language</CODE>, and <CODE>printer-uri</CODE>
attributes are required.

<P>The <CODE>printer-location</CODE>, <CODE>printer-info</CODE>,
<CODE>printer-more-info</CODE>, and <CODE>member-uris</CODE> attributes
are required when initially adding a printer and optional when modifying
a printer.

<P>Add class will return <CODE>ipp-ok</CODE>, <CODE>ipp-not-authorized</CODE>,
<CODE>ipp-bad-request</CODE>, or <CODE>ipp-attributes</CODE>.

<H3>Delete Class (CUPS_DELETE_CLASS = 0x4007)</H3>

<P>The delete class operation removes the specified class. The only
required attributes are <CODE>attributes-charset</CODE>,
<CODE>attributes-natural-language</CODE>, and <CODE>printer-uri</CODE>.

<P>Delete class will return <CODE>ipp-ok</CODE>, <CODE>ipp-not-found</CODE>,
or <CODE>ipp-not-authorized</CODE>.

<H3>Accept Jobs (CUPS_ACCEPT_JOBS = 0x4008)</H3>

<P>The accept jobs operation allows jobs to be accepted by the
specified destination. The only required attributes are
<CODE>attributes-charset</CODE>,
<CODE>attributes-natural-language</CODE>, and
<CODE>printer-uri</CODE>.

<P>Accept jobs will return <CODE>ipp-ok</CODE>, <CODE>ipp-not-found</CODE>,
or <CODE>ipp-not-authorized</CODE>.

<H3>Reject Jobs (CUPS_REJECT_JOBS = 0x4009)</H3>

<P>The reject jobs operation prevents jobs from being accepted by the
specified destination. The only required attributes are
<CODE>attributes-charset</CODE>,
<CODE>attributes-natural-language</CODE>, and
<CODE>printer-uri</CODE>.

<P>Reject jobs will return <CODE>ipp-ok</CODE>, <CODE>ipp-not-found</CODE>,
or <CODE>ipp-not-authorized</CODE>.

<H3>Set Default Destination (CUPS_SET_DEFAULT = 0x400A)</H3>

<P>The set default destination operation returns the printer attributes
for the system default printer or class. The only required attributes
are <CODE>attributes-charset</CODE>,
<CODE>attributes-natural-language</CODE>, and <CODE>printer-uri</CODE>.

<P>Set default destination will return <CODE>ipp-ok</CODE>,
<CODE>ipp-not-authorized</CODE>, <CODE>ipp-bad-request</CODE>, or
<CODE>ipp-not-found</CODE>.

<H2>Line Printer Daemon Protocol</H2>

<P>The Line Printer Daemon (LPD) protocol is described by
<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1179.txt">RFC 1179: Line Printer Daemon
Protocol</A>.

<P>The URI method name for LPD is "lpd".
