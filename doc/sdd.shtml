<H1>Scope</H1>

<H2>Identification</H2>

This software design description document provides detailed information 
on the architecture and coding of the Common UNIX Printing System 
(&quot;CUPS&quot;) Version 1.1.

<H2>System Overview</H2>

The Common UNIX Printing System provides a portable printing layer for 
UNIX&reg; operating systems. It has been developed by Easy Software 
Products to promote a standard printing solution for all UNIX vendors 
and users. CUPS provides the System V and Berkeley command-line interfaces.

<P>CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol (IETF-IPP) as the basis
for managing print jobs and queues. The Line Printer Daemon (LPD,
RFC1179), Server Message Block (SMB), and AppSocket protocols are also
supported with reduced functionality.

<P>CUPS adds network printer browsing and PostScript Printer
Description (&quot;PPD&quot;)-based printing options to support real
world applications under UNIX.

<P>CUPS also includes a customized version of GNU GhostScript
(currently based off GNU GhostScript 4.03) and an image file RIP that
can be used to support non-PostScript printers.

<H1>Design Overview</H1>

CUPS is composed of 7 software sub-systems that operate together to 
perform common printing tasks:

<UL>

	<LI>Backends

	<LI>Berkeley Commands

	<LI>CGI

	<LI>CUPS Interface Library

	<LI>Filters

	<LI>Scheduler

	<LI>System V Commands

</UL>

<H2>Backends</H2>

The backends implement communications over a number of different interfaces.
All backends are called with a common set of arguments:

<UL>

	<LI>Device URI - the Uniform Resource Identifier for the output device
	(e.g. <CODE>parallel:/dev/plp</CODE>,
	<CODE>ipp://hostname/resource</CODE>).

	<LI>Job Identifier - the job identifier for this job (integer).

	<LI>User Name - the user associated with this job (name string).

	<LI>Title - the title/job-name associated with this job (name string).

	<LI>Copies - the number of copies required (integer).

	<LI>Options - the options associated with this job (space separated
	option strings).

	<LI>Filename (optional) - the file to print; if this option is not
	specified, the backend must read the print file from the standard
	input.

</UL>

Backends are named using the method of the URI, so a URI of
"ipp://hostname/resource" would be processed by the "ipp" backend.

<H3>ipp</H3>

The ipp backend sends the specified job to a network printer or host using
the Internet Printing Protocol.  The URI is as specified by the
<CODE>printer-uri-supported</CODE> attribute from the printer or host.

<H3>lpd</H3>

The lpd backend sends the specified job to a network printer or host using
the Line Printer Daemon protocol.  The URI is of the form:

<UL><PRE>lpd://hostname/queue
</PRE></UL>

<H3>parallel</H3>

The parallel backend sends the specified job to a local printer connected
via the specified parallel port device.  The URI is of the form:

<UL><PRE>parallel:/dev/file
</PRE></UL>

<H3>serial</H3>

The serial backend sends the specified job to a local printer connected
via the specified serial port device.  The URI is of the form:

<UL><PRE>serial:/dev/file?option[+option+...]
</PRE></UL>

The options can be any combination of the following:

<UL>

	<LI><CODE>baud=<I>rate</I></CODE> - Sets the baud rate for the device.

	<LI><CODE>bits=<I>7 or 8</I></CODE> - Sets the number of data bits.

	<LI><CODE>parity=<I>even</I></CODE> - Sets even parity checking.

	<LI><CODE>parity=<I>odd</I></CODE> - Sets odd parity checking.

	<LI><CODE>parity=<I>none</I></CODE> - Turns parity checking off.

</UL>

<H3>socket</H3>

The socket backend sends the specified job to a network host using the
AppSocket protocol commonly used by Hewlett-Packard and Tektronix
printers.  The URI is of the form:

<UL><PRE>socket://hostname[:port]
</PRE></UL>

The default port number is 9100.

<H2>Berkeley Commands</H2>

The Berkeley commands provide a simple command-line interface to CUPS
to submit and control print jobs. It is provided for compatibility with
existing software that is hard coded to use the Berkeley commands.

<H3>lpc</H3>

The lpc command allows users and administrators to check the status and
control print queues.  The version provided with CUPS supports the following
commands:

<UL>

	<LI>quit - Quits the lpc command.

	<LI>status - Shows the status of printers and jobs in the queue.

</UL>

<H3>lpr</H3>

The lpr command submits a job for printing.  The CUPS version of lpr silently
ignores the "i", "t", "m", "h", and "s" options.

<H3>lprm</H3>

The lprm removes one or more print jobs.

<H2>CGI</H2>

The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs provide a web-based status interface
to monitor the status of printers, classes, and jobs.

<H3>classes.cgi</H3>

The classes CGI lists the available printer classes and any pending jobs for
the class.  The user can click on individual classes to limit the display and
click on jobs to see the job status.

<H3>jobs.cgi</H3>

The jobs CGI lists the queued print jobs in order of priority.  The list can
be limited by printer or job.  When the user displays the status of an
individual print job all job options are displayed.

<H3>printers.cgi</H3>

The printers CGI lists the available printer queues and any pending jobs for
the printer.  The user can click on individual printers to limit the display and
click on jobs to see the job status.

<H2>CUPS Interface Library</H2>

The CUPS interface library provides common convenience, HTTP, IPP,
language, MIME, PPD, and raster functions used by the CUPS software.

<H3>Convenience Functions</H3>

Convenience functions are provided to submit an IPP request, send a print file,
cancel a job, get a list of available printers, get a list of available
classes, get the default printer or class, get the default server name, get
the local username, and get a password string.

<H3>HTTP Functions</H3>

The HTTP functions provide functions to connect to HTTP servers, issue requests,
read data from a server, and write data to a server.

<H3>IPP Functions</H3>

The IPP function provide functions to manage IPP request data and attributes,
read IPP responses from a server, and write IPP requests to a server.

<H3>Language Functions</H3>

The language functions provide a standard interface for retrieving common
textual messages for a particular locale and determining the correct encoding
(e.g. US ASCII, ISO-8859-1, etc.)

<H3>MIME Functions</H3>

The Multimedia Internet Mail Exchange functions manage a MIME type and
conversion database that supports file typing by extension and content, and
least-cost file filtering from a source to a destination file type.

<H3>PPD Functions</H3>

The PostScript Printer Description functions manage PPD files, select options,
check for option conflicts, and emit selected options in the correct order.

<H3>Raster Functions</H3>

The raster functions manage streams of CUPS raster data (described in the
Interface Design Document) used by non-PostScript printer drivers.

<H2>Filters</H2>

The filters implement file conversion services for CUPS. All filters
are called with a common set of arguments:

<UL>

	<LI>Printer name - the name of the destination printer (name string).

	<LI>Job Identifier - the job identifier for this job (integer).

	<LI>User Name - the user associated with this job (name string).

	<LI>Title - the title/job-name associated with this job (name string).

	<LI>Copies - the number of copies required (integer).

	<LI>Options - the options associated with this job (space separated
	option strings).

	<LI>Filename (optional) - the file to print; if this option is not
	specified, the filter must read the input file from the standard
	input.

</UL>

Filters are added to the MIME conversion data file and implement all necessary
conversions from one file type to another.

<H3>hpgltops</H3>

The hpgltops filter converts HP-GL/2 files into PostScript.

<H3>imagetops</H3>

The imagetops filter converts image files into PostScript.

<H3>imagetoraster</H3>

The imagetoraster filter converts image files into CUPS raster data.

<H3>pstops</H3>

The pstops filter inserts printer-specific commands from PPD files and
performs page filtering as requested by the user.

<H3>pstoraster</H3>

The pstoraster filter converts PostScript program data into CUPS raster data.

<H3>rastertohp</H3>

The rastertohp filter handles converting CUPS raster data to HP PCL and
supports both color and black-and-white printers.

<H3>texttops</H3>

The texttops filter converts text files into PostScript.

<H2>Scheduler</H2>

The scheduler is a fully-functional HTTP/1.1 and IPP/1.1 server that
manages the printers, classes, and jobs in the system.  It also handles
a simple broadcast-based directory service so that remote print queues
and classes can be accessed transparently from the local system.

<H3>Authorization</H3>

The authorization module is responsible for performing access control and
authentication for all HTTP and IPP requests entering the system.

<H3>Classes</H3>

The classes module is responsible for managing printer classes in the system.
Each class is a collection of local and/or remote printers.  The classes module
also reads and writes the classes configuration file.

<H3>Client</H3>

The client module is responsible for all HTTP client communications.  It handles
listening on selected interfaces, accepting connections from prospective
clients, processing incoming HTTP requests, and sending HTTP responses to
those requests.  The client module also is responsible for executing the
external CGI programs as needed to support web-based printer, class, and job
status monitoring.

<P>Once authorized, all IPP requests are sent to the IPP module.

<H3>Configuration</H3>

The configuration module is responsible for reading the CUPS configuration file
and initializing the appropriate data structures and values.  The configuration
module also stops CUPS services before reading the configuration file and
restarts them after the configuration file has been read.

<H3>Directory Services</H3>

The directory services module sends and recieves printer state information over
a broadcast socket.  Remote printers and classes are automatically added to or
removed from the local printer and class lists as needed.

<P>The directory services module can only recieve printer state information
over a single UDP port, however it can broadcast to multiple addresses and
ports as needed.

<H3>IPP</H3>

The IPP module handles IPP requests and acts accordingly.  URI
validation is also performed here, as a client can post IPP data to any
URI on the server which might sidestep the access control or
authentication of the HTTP server.

<H3>Jobs</H3>

The jobs module manages print jobs, starts filter and backend processes
for jobs to be printed, and monitors status messages from those filters
and backends.

<H3>Logging</H3>

The logging module manages the access, error, and page log files that are
generated by the scheduler.

<H3>Main</H3>

The main module is responsible for timing out and dispatching input and output
for client connections.  It also watches for incoming <CODE>SIGHUP</CODE>
and <CODE>SIGCHLD</CODE> signals, reloads the server configuration files as
needed, and handles child process errors and exits.

<H3>Printers</H3>

The printers module is responsible for managing printers and PPD files
in the system. The printers module also reads and writes the printers
configuration file.

<H2>System V Commands</H2>

The System V commands provide a robust command-line interface to CUPS
to submit and control printers and jobs.

<H3>accept</H3>

The accept command tells the scheduler to accept new jobs for specific
printers.

<H3>cancel</H3>

The cancel command tells the scheduler to cancel one or more jobs that are
queued for printing.

<H3>disable</H3>

The disable command tells the scheduler to stop printing jobs on the
specified printers.

<H3>enable</H3>

The enable command tells the scheduler to start printing jobs on the
specified printers.

<H3>lp</H3>

The lp command submits submits files for printing.  Unlike the standard
System V lp command, a single CUPS lp command will generate a separate
job ID for each file that is printed. Also, the Solaris "f", "H", "P", "S",
and "y" options are silently ignored.

<H3>lpadmin</H3>

The lpadmin command manages printer queues and classes.  The Solaris
"A", "F", "I", "M", "P", "Q", "S", "T", "U", "W", "f", "l", "m", "o",
"s", "t", and "u" options are not supported, and new options "P" (PPD
file), "F" (filter), and "E" (enable and accept) are provided to configure
CUPS-specific features such as PPD file and conversion filters.

<H3>lpstat</H3>

The lpstat command lists printers, classes, and jobs as requested by the
user.

<H3>reject</H3>

The reject command tells the scheduler not to accept new jobs for specific
printers.
